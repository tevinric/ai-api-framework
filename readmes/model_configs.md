## GPT-4o-mini

#### Description

A fast, cost-effective version of GPT-4o designed for high-volume applications. Maintains strong performance across text and image understanding while offering significantly reduced costs. Ideal for chatbots, content generation, and applications requiring quick responses without compromising quality.

GPT-4o mini enables a broad range of tasks with its low cost and latency, such as applications that chain or parallelize multiple model calls (e.g., calling multiple APIs), pass a large volume of context to the model (e.g., full code base or conversation history), or interact with customers through fast, real-time text responses (e.g., customer support chatbots).

Today, GPT-4o mini supports text and vision in the API, with support for text, image, video and audio inputs and outputs coming in the future. The model has a context window of 128K tokens and knowledge up to October 2023. Thanks to the improved tokenizer shared with GPT-4o, handling non-English text is now even more cost effective.
