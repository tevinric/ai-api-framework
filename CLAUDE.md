You are given my code base for an AI API framework. 

Your task is as follows: 

1. Create a REACT Front end (add a new folder called front end) to act as the Admin portal for managing my AI APIS
2. The admin portal will allow admin users to perform the following tasks:
    - Add, update and delete users (See the apis/admin folder for the api functions)
    - Add, or remove endpoint access for a user (single, multi or all):
        - Allow user to search a user by their common name to first see which endpoints they have access to (Show the endpoint name. See the sql_init folder to see sql table structure and determine how to link the tables)
        - Allow admin to assign a new endpoint access (either single, multi or all)
        - Allow admin to remove endpoint access (either single, multi or all)

All your work for the front end must be added to the new folder.

DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE BACKEND FILES FOR NOW!
