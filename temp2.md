You are given the following api function files for file management.

You must deliver the following:

1.  I want a new html page tempate created call "File Management Portal"
2. This page will be added to the sidebar so that when the user clicks on it then it takes the user to the template for this.
3. This page will be a file management portal that allows users to supply their apiKey in an input form field at the top.
4. The api key will be used to get the user id and the user id will be used to find all of the files that were uploaded/generated by this user and stored in the the azure blob store.
5. When the user gets authenicated with the api key, you must display the user details on the page (Name, department, scope name, number of files uploaded and number of files generated, date created, .)
6. You must have a sidebar on the left which shows the list of file names (Section1 - uploaded files and Section2 - generated files). Show the original file name and not the blob name
7. These files will only show once the user passes in their api key and gets authenticated
8. Only the files uploaded or generated by this user must be shown in the side bar
9. The main conatiner to the right of the sidebar must be used to display the file when the user clicks on the file from the sidebar - the file must be streamed and displayed
10. You must have a robust file viewer that will display the file if it is an image, audio, pdf, word, excel, ppt or any other displayable file. 
11. Any file that cannot be displayed must show display an icon shwoing that the file cannot be displayed

13. If the user chooses to delete the file then the DELETE file endpoint must be called to delete the file using the file id of the selected image. Note you must use the apikey key to generate a token using the GET token endpoint and then use that token in the header to authenticate the deletion of the file.
14. Show a pop up with Are you sure you want to delete this file warning. Only if user selects yes will the file be deleted. 
15. Please also include a search bar at the top of the page below the header (only after the user is authenticated with the apiKey). this search bar will accept a file id.
16. When the user passes a file_id in the search bar then that file will be pulled and displayed in the same main section. Do not show any other files. This must gove the user the option to manage a file directly.
