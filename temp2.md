        "content": " - Is there such a thing as cheap car insurance? - Anyone can get cheap car insurance. However, we believe that when it comes to cheap car insurance, you get what you pay for! Your premium may be cheap, but you might also be locked into a lot of unnecessary rules about how much you can drive, where, and when. At 1st for Women, we don&rsquo;t want to hold you back, which is why we don&rsquo;t place unreasonable restrictions on you. We aim to offer some of the most affordable women&rsquo;s car insurance in South Africa. While it isn\"t easy to put a price on your wellbeing, we strive to maintain affordable Car Insurance designed specifically for women. All while offering excellent coverage and benefits to help you feel safe. That&rsquo;s why you can save money when you switch to 1st for Women. - Can I use a vehicle repairer of my choice? - Since 2004, we have established excellent working relationships with our network of car experts, and we want you to get the most out of this pre-established network. That&rsquo;s why we insist on using panel beaters of our choice. This way, we can guarantee the quality of the work done on your car. In fact, we offer a lifetime guarantee on the repair work when you claim through us, whether it&rsquo;s a quick paint fix or major panel beating. - How do I lower my car insurance premiums? - There are a few ways you can lower your car insurance premiums: Increase the excess you are required to pay when you claim. However, paying the lowest excess will increase your monthly premium. Ideally, you want a balance between your premium and your excess. By combining your policies, you qualify for discounted premiums. Review your cover annually. Individual circumstances are subject to change, including your coverage needs, like if you&rsquo;ve recently moved to a safer area. - What is the best car insurance? - We&rsquo;ve put together our insurance options with all kinds of women in mind. The best vehicle insurance for you will depend on your own needs. Our Comprehensive Car Insurance offers the best protection against the most extensive array of risks. However, if you rarely drive your car or are looking for insurance for an older, less valuable car, Third Party, Fire and Theft or Third Party Only Cover could be right for you. - Will my premiums decrease as my car gets older? - When you insure your car, you aren\"t only covered for theft, but also for the repair of your vehicle. As your car ages, the cost of repairs and individual parts increase every year. Unfortunately, your premium will need to increase to align with these costs. However, 1st for Women does consider the depreciating value of your car when reviewing your premium on an annual basis. "

        "content": " - Am I covered if an accident is my fault? - At 1st for Women, we know no one is perfect. Whether you have a lot on your mind, something is bothering you, or you just look away for a second, accidents can happen. You shouldn&rsquo;t be punished if you accidentally cause a collision. Instead, you need the support of an insurer who understands how stressful this situation can be. Therefore, with us, we&rsquo;ll cover you even if an accident is your fault. - What does Comprehensive Car Insurance cover in South Africa? - Comprehensive Car Insurance cover offers the most robust car insurance with protection against car accidents and collisions, theft, claims by third parties, fire damage and other events, like hail damage or windshield repairs. - What is not covered under Comprehensive Car Insurance? - While we cover most risks and eventualities under our Comprehensive Car Insurance, there are a few exceptions. These include driving under the influence, driving with an endorsed or endorsed licence, unlawfully leaving the scene of an accident, driving an unroadworthy vehicle, leaving your keys in your car, and if your car is used for business purpose. We also won&rsquo;t pay out if you or someone else uses your car for racing or if you transport more than the legal number of passengers in the car. - Does Comprehensive Car Insurance cover me or my car? - While our Comprehensive Car Insurance is specifically designed for women, the product covers your car, not you as its owner. That&rsquo;s because we want you to be insured even if someone else drives your car. Which, let&rsquo;s face it, could happen quite easily. This means that if you drive someone else&rsquo;s car and have an accident, the owner of that car will need to claim on their insurance, not you. - How often can I use the Assist Benefits? - You can use our Road and Home Assist benefits up to three times per year. This means you can request a tow truck three times in a year if you face repeated car troubles. Similarly, if you just have a run of bad luck at home, like your geyser bursts, the kids smash a window, and your house key breaks in the front door lock, you can call on us to help you out.When it comes to our Medical Assist, you can use our 24/7 telephonic helpline as often as you like. Whenever you feel panicked about the health of a loved one, our medical experts are available.Our Tax, Legal and Finance and Concierge Assist are also available all-year-round. Use these services as many times as you need to."

        "content": " - Is Third Party, Fire and Theft worth it? - This depends on your unique circumstances, because Third Party, Fire and Theft Cover isn&rsquo;t right for everyone. Here&rsquo;s a quick checklist to determine if you need this type of car insurance:Your car has a low retail, market, or trade value.Your car doesn&rsquo;t cost a lot to repair.Your car is fairly old.If you can identify with all of these considerations then Third Party, Fire and Theft Cover could be right for you. That&rsquo;s because repairing the damage to your own car in an accident is affordable. Or you don&rsquo;t mind waiting and saving up to repair it (as long as it&rsquo;s still roadworthy, of course). - What’s covered by third party, fire and theft insurance? - Third party fire and theft will cover the cost of damage or loss to another vehicle in the event of car accident or collision that you caused. It also covers one&rsquo;s own vehicle for theft or hijacking and the damage caused by fire. - What’s not covered by third party fire and theft? - 3rd Party, Fire and Theft Insurance is a fairly extensive type of insurance. However, it does not cover you for accident damage your own car regardless of whether an accident was your fault or not. You&rsquo;ll have to foot the bill yourself if you need to repair or replace your vehicle.Aside from this, 3rd Party, Fire and Theft Insurance won&rsquo;t cover you for illegal behaviours, like drunk driving, driving with an endorsed licence. - What’s the difference between third party, fire and theft, and comprehensive insurance? - Comprehensive car insurance offers the widest type of protection, covering policyholders for third party damage, as well as the cost to one&rsquo;s own vehicle in the event of a car accident or collision. It also covers one for theft and damage from fire and other elements. Third Party, Fire and Theft offers less cover as it only covers third party property damage, if the insured vehicle is stolen or damaged by fire."

        "description": "",
        "content": " - What does Third Party Insurance mean? - Third Party Insurance is basic car insurance that covers any accidental damages to third party property caused by the vehicles on cover and for which the driver is legally liable.  - What isn’t covered under Third Party Only Car Insurance? - 1st for Women doesn&rsquo;t cover damage to your own car if you&rsquo;re involved in an accident, whether it was your fault or not. We also don&rsquo;t cover you if your car is stolen, hijacked. This type of insurance plan was specifically designed to give you just the basics with an affordable monthly premium. We also don&rsquo;t cover you if you do anything illegal in your car, like drive without a valid licence or drive while under the influence. - What is legal liability? - Legal liability is a technical term that means you&rsquo;re responsible to pay for the damages if you cause an accident. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how it happened &ndash; whether you looked away for a second at your radio station, lost concentration, or misjudged a gap in oncoming traffic. Depending on the circumstances of the accident, you might damage one or multiple people&rsquo;s cars; either way, you might be held legally liable to pay for the repairs or replacement of the vehicles damaged. - What do I do if I cause an accident? - If you cause an accident, it&rsquo;s important to remain calm and treat it the same way you would any other road incident. First, make sure you and the other people involved are OK. Once you&rsquo;ve established that, you can see if it&rsquo;s safe to move your vehicles. Then, exchange details with the third parties involved, like contact information, car registration, and insurance details. Report the accident at the nearest police station then submit your claim to us. Once we have the details of the incident from you and the case number from the SAPS, we&rsquo;ll take it from there."

        "content": " - What’s the difference between the retail, market and trade car values? - These are the three standard values for any car in South Africa.Retail value means that if you went to a dealership to buy your car right now, what you&rsquo;d pay is the retail value. Traditionally, this is the highest value for which you could insure yourself. If you sold your car on the private market, you&rsquo;d get the market value for it. Market value is the trade value and retail value added together and divided by two. Trade value is the lowest value for which you can insure your car. A dealership would offer you this if you traded it in for a newer vehicle. - Who should get BetterCar Insurance? - We recommend that anyone with a vehicle not older than eight years insures their car for the BetterCar Value.  - Will you pay me out in cash or buy another vehicle on my behalf? - 1st for Women insurance will pay you out in cash if you claim from your Comprehensive Car Insurance policy if it has the BetterCar Value. Whatever the same model car but one year newer costs at the time that your car is written off, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll pay you. If there isn&rsquo;t a newer version of your model, we will pay out 15% more than its retail value. "

It secures a company\"s stability and continuity during an unforeseen event or a crisis. - What insurance is most important for a business? - The type of Business Insurance in South Africa that is most critical for a business will ultimately depend on the nature of your business and its unique risks.

        "description": "",
        "content": " - What does Public Liability Insurance cover? - What yourPublic Liability Insurance covers will depend on the amount of coverage you take out. Your policy documents will detail what&rsquo;s covered and the maximum amount your liability coverage will pay out in the event of an incident. Most insurers cover you for accidental damage and injury. - What’s excluded from a Public Liability Insurance policy? - Public liability cover typically excludes intentional incidents. This means that if you or your employees intentionally harm someone or damage their property, your Liability Insurance policy will not pay out for a third-party claim. Your policy documents will include more details about your customised inclusions and exclusions. - How much Liability Insurance do you need? - You&rsquo;ll want to look for a cover specifically designed for you because there is no fixed amount that will work for all businesses. While the value of the fixed property can easily be estimated should it need repairing or replacing, the cost of damages and medical bills can vary widely. 1st for Women looks at a number of factors when calculating how much Public Liability Insurance you need. Some of these include: The specifics of your business. This includes the size of your business, where it&rsquo;s located, how many staff members you employ, the experience of your employees, the type of ownership you have over the business, and turnover.How much risk the business is exposed to? While the insurer&rsquo;s job is to insure the business adequately, the owner knows their business best. So, if you&rsquo;re getting liability cover quotes, you&rsquo;ll need to guide the insurer on what risks your business might face. Try to be comprehensive, so you&rsquo;re covered for as many eventualities as possible.The types of injuries a third party might suffer on your premises or because of your property or products. In a lawsuit, damages will be awarded based on the type of injury, its extent, the loss of income resulting from it, medical expenses, and emotional suffering. Even though no one can predict these, insurers can calculate risk based on stats from previous claims and make sure you&rsquo;re insured enough to cover you if a third party&rsquo;s injury is severe.Industry requirements. Some professional bodies require their members to have a specific level of cover. - Who should take out Public Liability Insurance? - Any business owner needs Liability Insurance.Anyone who deals with public third parties, like customers, clients, suppliers or distributors, should be protected against liability. An unexpected accident that causes bodily injury or property damage to a third party, who could find the business owner responsible for medical costs or property damage if you&rsquo;re found to have been negligent or at fault. It may also be a requirement from your landlord to have liability cover if you&rsquo;re renting business premises. - How are liability damages calculated? - Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t just one formula for calculating damages. Each case is examined individually, and the damages awarded are based on the facts of that specific incident. Some portions of damages, like existing medical bills, are easy to work out. Others, like future medical bills, are trickier. Often, an actuary will be appointed by the court to calculate damages based on a number of factors, including:Existing and future medical expenses.Emotional damage and physical suffering. This is often determined by the physical pain experienced following an injury or illness, the time it takes to fully recover, and how much a person&rsquo;s life has been disrupted due to the incident.Costs to repair or replace property.Current and future lost income.Sick leave used to recover.What is fair to both the person claiming and the business being sued."

        "content": " - What is not covered under Business Interruption Insurance? - Business Interruption Insurance typically doesn&rsquo;t cover events such as routine maintenance, planned shutdowns, or voluntary closures. It also excludes damage caused by normal wear and tear and utility service interruptions beyond one&rsquo;s control. Understanding your policy\"s exclusions is crucial for proper risk management and contingency planning. - How is Business Interruption Insurance treated in accounting? - In accounting, Business Interruption Insurance is treated as a contingent liability until an actual loss event occurs. When a covered event disrupts business operations, a business interruption claim is made. The amount received is recorded as income, compensating for lost revenue and continuing expenses during the interruption. These proceeds help maintain financial stability during recovery.  It\"s crucial for businesses to accurately document losses and expenses to ensure proper accounting and compliance with insurance policies. Proper record-keeping and financial reporting are essential for a smooth claims process and financial recovery. - What are the most common causes of business interruption? - The most common causes of business interruption include natural disasters like floods, fires, and earthquakes, which can damage facilities and disrupt operations. Other factors include equipment breakdowns, supply chain disruptions, and cyberattacks that can halt production or disrupt services.  - What are the consequences of business interruption? - Business interruption can have severe consequences, including financial losses from disrupted revenue streams and increased expenses. It can damage a company\"s reputation due to service disruptions, potentially leading to customer loss. Long-term consequences can include market share loss and difficulties in regaining momentum. Business Interruption Insurance helps mitigate these risks by providing financial support during recovery, helping the business return to normal operations and reducing the long-term impact."

        "content": " - How do pet insurance claims work? -  With pet insurance claims, the policyholder pays for veterinary services and submits a claim to their insurers. The insurer will reimburse the policyholder for the covered expenses up to the policy&rsquo;s limits and deductibles. You just need to submit a claim form, invoice, and proof of payment from the vet.  Claims for admission to an animal hospital or for surgery require pre-authorisation. For a planned procedure, this should be done before your pet is admitted. A veterinary history may be requested if further information is required. You can submit a claim via email at petclaims@firstforwomen or call us at 0861 20 13 13.  - What is included in the Wellness Benefit? - Our Wellness Benefit pays towards routine, preventative care which covers voluntary sterilisation, vaccinations, deworming, tick and flea control, anal gland expression and nail clipping.  - Does pet insurance cover sterilisation?  - Yes, provided you have the Wellness Benefit, your policy with 1st for Women will pay towards voluntary sterilisation for your pets. - How are policies underwritten? - You&rsquo;ll be asked to disclose any pre-existing conditions when you take out a policy."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Did you know that South Africa’s beauty and personal care industry is worth over R3 billion? Despite Covid-19 forcing some hair salons, spas, salons and boutiques to temporarily close between 2019 and 2021, the industry has rebounded in 2022 as South Africans flock to pamper themselves ahead of the festive season.If your beauty business survived Covid-19, you might be tempted to forget the uncertainty of the past few years and its negative impact. While it’s always a good idea to focus on the future, taking steps to protect your business can give you peace of mind should the unthinkable happen. Here\"s how hair and beauty salon insurance from First for Women can help accomplish this.Do I need hair and beauty insurance?For decades, businesses have existed to help people beautify themselves, with customers turning to professionals to improve their hair, makeup, nails and more. As time has passed, more businesses have popped up under the beauty industry umbrella to accommodate new trends. Salons offering tanning, teeth whitening and eyelash extensions now co-exist with those offering traditional services like blow waves and facials. Your business might be one of them.If you’re wondering “do hairdressers need insurance?“ or any other beauty business for that matter, the answer is yes. All businesses in this category can benefit from insurance – whether the business in questions offer nail extensions out of someone’s house or involves a professional salon setup in a shopping mall.As the beauty industry is so diverse, a generic insurance solution is unlikely to offer you value. You’ll want a custom package that affordably caters to your business’s needs and nobody else’s.What type of hair or beauty salon insurance do you need?When it comes to business insurance, it helps to understand that no single best hair salon insurance or beautician insurance exists. For adequate coverage, you’ll likely benefit from a curated portfolio of insurance policies. Here are some elements that most hair and beauty insurance coverage can include:1. Commercial property insuranceAny space that you dedicate to your business operations is considered commercial property. This means that even if you operate out of an outbuilding on the same property as your home, you’ll qualify for coverage. Commercial property insurance usually covers the structure of the building and any permanent installations made to it. It can also include the products, equipment and tools you use to conduct business.Tak a look at this example: Janelle purchases a small house in a residential area and converts it into a salon filled with shelves where she sells hair products. A massive storm takes place, and a tree crashes through the front of the salon. Commercial insurance will cover the cost of repairing the broken front window and brick work as well as replace any lost merchandise.2. Liability insuranceThis type of insurance can financially protect you against any claims made against yourself, your business or your employees whether the incident in question was preventable or intentional. It will cover the cost of legal representation and can cover you against legal action employees or the public take against you based on your business or its products and services. The larger your business is, the greater liability it will usually face.For example, imagine that Nandi, a professional nail technician, founds her own nail salon and outfits it with equipment. One day, a client complains that they developed an unpleasant infection after having their nails done at Nandi’s salon. Upon investigation, Nandi realises that some of her nail equipment was defective, causing it to harbour harmful bacteria. Although the fault doesn’t lie with Nandi, her liability insurance allows her to pay for her client’s medical bills and prevents her reputation from being compromised.3. Trade or equipment insuranceYour business likely relies on a range of complex equipment to help it safely, quickly and effectively meet clients’ beauty needs. Should this equipment get damaged or require replacement, it could put your business out of commission for months while you raise the necessary funds. Trade or equipment insurance can safeguard against this.Vanya, for example, has owned a popular tanning salon for over a decade and her clients trust her to offer them a safe and comfortable tanning experience. She’s invested in high-end tanning beds that can customise their exact UV lamp outputs to individual client’s needs. Constant loadshedding leads to one of the tanning beds to short-circuit. Because Vanya has insured the beds for their actual value, she can replace the broken tanning bed with the exact same make and model without having to dip into any savings.4. Business interruption insuranceWhen something goes wrong in your business, it’s easy to forget that recovering from it can cost you more than the price of the asset that needs replacement or repair. For every day your business can’t operate normally, you can expect a partial or total dip in your profitability. Even if you have the equipment or property insurance, it will not help you meet your financial obligations, which will keep on coming without regard for your ability to operate. Business interruption insurance will help you pay the bills until you can resume normal functioning.It means that a business owner like Vanya can continue paying her monthly rent and staff salaries while she waits for the tanning bed to be replaced, even while she can only take on half the bookings she usually does. This will lessen the financial burden placed on the business, giving her leeway to recover from the unfortunate incident.

        "heading": "Difference Between Pet Insurance & Pet Medical Aid",
        "description": "",
        "content": "Your pets are precious family members and you want them to live long happy and healthy lives. To make sure they get medical help when they need it, you’ve invested in pet medical aid. What you might not know is that often, medical aid won’t fully cover their treatment (and your costs) should your pet need an operation or need emergency care. So, supplementing your pet medical aid with the right pet insurance can keep this from happening.Here’s what you need to know about the difference between pet medical aid and pet insurance and why First for Women\"s pet insurance cover can suit you (and your furry friend’s) needs.Why do people buy insurance for their pets?Many people don’t realise just how much emergency pet care costs can escalate. Even with careful training and attention, accidents do happen. It can take seconds for a curious puppy to swallow a stray piece of Lego or a dropped chicken bone. Foreign object removal (one of the most common and costly veterinary procedures) can end up costing you thousands of rands.Even if you’ve diligently paid your pet medical aid every month, you could find that it doesn’t cover such an extensive or complex procedure. And if you simply don’t have the money to spare, you might have to make a heartbreaking decision on behalf of your pet. People buy pet insurance* for their pets for extra peace of mind. It gives them the reassurance that, should the unexpected occur to their pet, their treatment won\"t rake up a massive bill.Pet medical aid vs insurance: what’s the difference?Although they’re often referred to interchangeably, pet medical aid and pet insurance are distinct products with different types of coverage.What is pet medical aid and what does it cover?Generally speaking, pet medical aid helps cover the day to day costs of having a pet. This can include scheduled appointments for planned procedures, such as having your pet spayed, getting their teeth cleaned or taking them for an annual check-up. It can also cover minor but common health issues your pet might face, such as a worm infestation or a minor accident. Many pet medical aids offer additional benefits like coverage for behavioural training or emergency boarding should you go on holiday or be temporarily unable to care for them.The coverage you get from your pet medical aid will differ according to the level of coverage you’re paying for and what the insurer offers. Depending on your coverage, it might not cover hereditary diseases that are common in your breed of pet. It also might not cover any personal liability claims. This would cover you financially should your pet injure another pet or person or damage someone\"s property or belongings.What is pet insurance and what does it cover?Depending on your level of coverage, pet insurance covers all or some of the larger costs of your pet\"s medical treatment. It can limit its cover to accidental and emergency procedures (such as your pet getting hit by a car or swallowing a nail) to more comprehensive coverage (treating them for cancer and other major diseases).You can think of your pet insurance as an emergency fund that kicks in when you need it the most and that you generally won\"t rely on to keep your pet well on a daily basis. Unlike medical aid, pet insurance takes into account that the circumstances for you using your insurance can differ dramatically from how you use your pet medical aid. It’s why in many cases, a waiting period won’t apply to you or you won’t need to pay an excess.Important Differences Between Pet Medical Aid And Pet InsurancePet medical aid and pet insurance products are administered differently. Understanding this is important as it can inform the coverage you receive. Pet medical aids operate similarly to human medical aid schemes as they both aren\"t permitted to operate at a profit. On the other hand, pet insurance is governed by short term insurance laws and underwritten by insurance companies, allowing it to make a profit. This matters, as it means that there are no prescribed minimum benefits medical aids must cover at all levels.To make sure you enjoy the full benefits from your pet insurance or pet medical aid, you need to clearly understand what each product offers. A number of factors can affect this, such as how exotic your pet is, how old they are, and if they have any pre-existing conditions. This will influence what exclusions or inclusions apply so that you can rest assured that your coverage will be more than sufficient.What you can expect to pay for pet insurance in South Africa?Pet insurance prices vary dramatically in South Africa, with the average coming in at R250 to R300 a month. However, this depends on the coverage being provided. For example, First for Women\"s Fur Baby Basic entry-level plan covers accidents and major surgeries for just R100 per dog or cat, per month. It\"s a good choice for older pets who might not qualify for or need comprehensive coverage. Alternatively, the Premium Paws plan costs R550 per dog and R320 per cat. This plan offers higher value coverage than the entry-level plan and also covers diagnostics and scans.Get a pet insurance quote from First for WomenPet insurance might seem to offer similar benefits to your existing pet medical aid, but it could be a lifesaver should you be faced with a health or medical emergency.

        "content": "The severe tropical cyclone, Dineo, is set to make landfall imminently and as such, we would like to ensure our customers stay safe during the heavy rains that are reported to follow over the course of the week.Residents in parts of Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Northern KwaZulu-Natal, in particular, have been warned to take care as heavy rains are expected across these areas.If you live in one of these areas, we’ve prepared some tips to help you keep yourself and your loved ones safe. HEAVY RAIN: Try to make arrangements to park your car undercover and delay travelling until the storm has subsided.If you are caught in a heavy storm, look for cover, such as a covered car park, a petrol station or under a bridge. However, take extreme care when pulling over; put on your hazard lights, and don’t risk your safety or the safety of others by dashing madly for cover.Don’t park under trees as there is a danger of falling branches and debris. Stay in your car and only leave the safety of your sheltered spot when the storm has passed.If you’re on the road and visibility is too poor or the road is too slippery, rather pull over and switch on your car’s hazard lights until visibility or traction improves.If possible, make sure that any dead and rotting branches are removed from trees to avoid the risk of falling debris during a severe storm. Also, ensure that debris is removed from roofs and gutters.If you have outdoor furniture, make sure it is safely stored or firmly secured.The power surge of a lightning strike can easily overload most appliances and devices. It’s best to unplug these before the storm arrives. FLOODS: It is a good idea to purchase your own supply of sandbags which can be placed against doorways and low-level vents in times of flooding to help minimise the amount of water that enters your home. Also, move high-value items to the highest possible floor or shelf if a flood threatens.General and regular home maintenance, like clearing debris from gutters, is essential and will most definitely limit damages and discomfort in times of disaster.Turn off gas and electricity if flooding occurs.Rather do not attempt to drive in flood conditions. Remember that just 15cm of moving water can knock you off your feet and water just 60cm deep can sweep a vehicle away. Generally, if the water is deeper than the bottom of your doors or the bottom third of your wheels, it is not advisable to drive through it.Flash flooding often occurs when rivers flow over low-lying bridges.  Avoid crossing bridges or roads next to rivers during heavy rains. If you do get stuck on a flooded road, it’s best to switch to the lowest possible gear and proceed slowly. If you approach a flooding stormwater drain at speed, rather take your foot off the accelerator slowly and let your speed drop gradually; if you use the brakes suddenly, your car may skid or aquaplane.If you’re unable to drive your car during flooding, rather abandon the vehicle and climb to higher ground. It is dangerous to try and drive out of the water to safety.If you need to make a claim due to damage from these storms, you can get in touch with us by calling 0861 11 18 05 or you can send an email to claims@firstforwomen.co.za."

        "description": "",
        "content": "If you own a car, the chances are high that you have a car insurance policy. It&rsquo;s a smart choice to protect your vehicle asset and to ensure you are covered in the case of a fender bender, or a more serious car accident in which someone is hurt or your vehicle is seriously damaged. It&rsquo;s also wise because your vehicle may fall victim to criminal activity. Stats SA reported the 2019/2020 motor theft figures sat an estimated 88 000 incidences for that period in South Africa.1 While we are all aware of the main reasons to insure a car, many women do not realise that a good car insurance policy may also protect you from a variety of other unexpected risks. Find out more as First for Women unpacks these hidden car insurance benefits. 1. Car insurance can make safety a number one priority If you&rsquo;ve ever had a flat tyre in the middle of the night, a car that won&rsquo;t start in a storm or a breakdown in an unknown neighbourhood, you know that it is not just an inconvenience, it&rsquo;s also downright terrifying. Suddenly you feel vulnerable and in danger, not knowing when or if help will arrive or if a passing motorist poses a threat to you. Fortunately, most leading car insurance companies, like First for Women, provide a bespoke 24/7 Guardian Angel on Call service during which time a representative of the company is sent to your location to wait with you until a qualified car mechanic is dispatched to fix your mechanical problem. Whether you are alone or with your kids, we believe that your safety should be a priority. Also, a good insurance company will have an app or crash detection system that you can use so that if you&rsquo;re ever involved in a serious car accident, you don&rsquo;t even need to call in. The app or device will register the impact and alert the necessary medical and roadside authorities. First for Women is aware that speed is of great importance when providing healthcare to accident victims, which is the reason we have been working to ensure you get the critical care you need as soon as possible.2. Car insurance can help make your life easierIsn&rsquo;t it always the case &ndash; when you&rsquo;re really busy, that&rsquo;s when Murphy&rsquo;s Law strikes. And something that could go wrong, does go wrong.  Good insurance for vehicles could help you when you&rsquo;re in a fix.  Run out of fuel? They&rsquo;ll bring you petrol or diesel to get you moving again.Hit a pothole and got a flat? They will come out and help change your tyres.Lost your keys? They will pay for you to get a new set. Flying stone chipped your screen? They will repair or replace, as necessary.To qualify for this service, simply download the Guardian on Call app from Google Play or the Apple App Store and save 0860 104 211 on your phone for future communications. When you call, simply provide your ID number, and describe your car problem. And once your membership is confirmed, help will be on the way. No judgements and no hassles. Just fast and reliable solutions, which is what every busy woman really needs.3. Car insurance for sophisticated livingSome car insurance policies can even provide cover for things that have nothing to do with your car, but everything to do with creating a sophisticated lifestyle for the modern woman, like providing you with contact details for plumbers, electricians, and other service people from a trusted and approved network should disaster strike. Take care of that flooded loo just before you have friends round for a dinner party. Depending on the type of car insurance that you have, you may even find that your insurance gives you access to concierge services. This convenient service could help you book movie tickets, make restaurant reservations, or arrange a flight.So, in addition to providing affordable car insurance, First for Women offers the Guardian Angel on Call lifestyle benefit, which extends to help within the home and health, as our Home Assist and Medical Assist can help organise your life when you&rsquo;re busy and constantly on the go, or provide health-related assistance if someone required medical support. We even offer expert Legal and Tax Assist. Discover more about our roadside assistance and lifestyle benefit options here. 4. Car insurance for weather damaging mishaps Weather can be wonderful, or it can be wild but it is very rarely 100% predictable. You may not think too much about it, but bad weather and natural disasters can pose significant risks to you and your vehicle. Hail, flooding, and fire can put your life at risk and damage your property. Your car insurance may offer you partial or full protection against these elemental challenges. Read your policy documents closely so that you&rsquo;re duly informed about these risks and cover. In the case that your car is badly damaged by inclement weather, rest easy knowing that your insurer can cover the damage and even can pay for a tow truck to move your car to a safer location and arrange for storage costs if those become necessary. That&rsquo;s good news for your bank balance and even more reason to make sure you insure a car. Get a car insurance quote from First for WomenCars are the ultimate symbol of freedom and adventure &ndash; go where you want, when you want.

        "content": "There are few things as exciting (or as terrifying) as buying your very first home! But don’t panic, we’ve got you covered with our handy guideline to some of the basic things you need to know about buying a home – and some things you might not have thought of Make sure you’re aware of all the costs Unfortunately buying a house typically costs a lot more than most people expect. Firstly, there’s the actual cost of the house and then there are transfer fees, lawyer fees, the cost of a rate clearance certificate, Buildings Insurance… all of which can add up – fast. So make sure that when you’re organising your finances for your new home, you budget for all these extras too. Check out the neighbourhood People often say it’s better to spend more money on a smaller house in a really good neighbourhood, than a more affordable, larger house somewhere less desirable. The reason being is that your home will probably be the biggest asset you own, so you’ll want to make sure that nothing might compromise its value in the future. In the same vein, be sure to check with town planning about any future developments in the area that could also potentially affect the value of your home. Always think ahead It always a good idea to think ahead when buying a home. For instance, if you want to have kids, it’s a good idea to consider buying a home in an area where there are good schools and parks. Plus, you should also take into account your work commute – and consider the distance you’ll travel every day and the related travel costs. Bring in the experts You might have fallen in love with your dream home at first sight, but you still need to make sure that there won’t be any nasty surprises before you sign on the dotted line. You always need to check for things like damp, cracks, or electrical issues. Bring in someone to inspect and sign off on your new place before you do. Plus, always ask the owners about previous repairs and renovations, so you’ll know what to take a deeper look at. Be sure to check the little things When looking around a potential new home, don’t forget about the smaller details. Check the water pressure in the taps and showers, make sure your phone gets a good signal, and definitely ask about the neighbours. These are little things that could turn into bigger problems later on!"

        "content": "Cyber attacks and online bullying is a growing concern that has escalated in recent years. Vodafone conducted a survey[1] which found that one in five teenagers has been victimised. Unfortunately, legal intervention can be extremely expensive. To address the emotional and financial implications of online bullying and other types of cyber attacks, First for Women launched Cyber Insurance, which includes online or cyberbullying coverage, among its many benefits. What is cyberbullying?Online or cyberbullying uses technology, often social media platforms, to harass, humiliate or threaten someone. This can take many forms, like hurtful comments, posting images or making threats. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying can be done anonymously, which makes it difficult to stop. The consequences of this abuse are very serious, especially for children and teenagers. Consistent bullying has been linked to poor mental health issues, like low self-esteem, depression and even suicidal thoughts and behaviour. This is the reason why parents and caregivers need to be aware of the impact so they can take measures to address the bullying and prevent future attacks. Types of cyberbullyingFirst things first, you need to understand the different types of cyberbullying. Some of the most common forms of abuse include:   1. Online harassment. This is an ongoing, consistent, intentional form of cyberbullying where the cyberbully sends abusive, threatening, and malicious messages. Similar to harassment is flaming. This involves posting insults on social media, which are often filled with offensive language and profanity. Insults may turn into ‘flame wars’ where two or more people join forces to attack the victim. 2. Exclusion. The act of deliberately leaving someone out. This can occur in various ways, on and offline, including:Exclusion from online groups like chats and social sites.Exclusion from mentions in online conversations – for example, tagging other friends and deliberately excluding someone.Exclusion from friends’ parties or activities.Exclusion from conversations because he/she isn’t on social media or doesn’t have a smartphone.It also often involves leaving malicious comments on a person’s social media pages. 3. Hacking. This is an act aimed at ruining your reputation by impersonating them online. The cyberbully will gain access to your social media login details, log in to your accounts, and post defamatory and inappropriate content on your social pages. 4. Masquerading. This is when a cyberbully creates a false identity to harass someone online anonymously. He/she may pose as someone else and send malicious messages to his/her victim.   5. Catfishing. The use of a fake online profile with the intent to lure people into a relationship, often romantic, through a process of deception. The cyberbully may or may not be someone the victim knows, but either way, they intend to gain their victim’s trust and get them to share personal information, which they then share online to humiliate and embarrass that person. Teenagers are especially susceptible to catfishing as they may often ‘befriend’ people even if they don’t know them and tend to overshare their emotions and details of their lives online. 6. Outing. The aim of outing is to publicly humiliate a person by sharing private, sensitive or embarrassing content without their consent. Once the content has been spread around online, the victim has been ‘outed’. 7. Defamation. This is when the cyberbully sends or posts cruel comments online, which can affect someone’s self-confidence and damage their reputation. 8. Trickery. Trickster cyberbullies will falsely befriend you and gain your trust, getting you to share embarrassing details and secrets and then share this information online or send it to other people. 9. Sexting. This refers to the exchange of sexually explicit photos, videos or messages, usually via messaging apps on cell phones. Sexting is not only illegal but can have severe, far-reaching effects. If a cyberbully shares this content online, this could cause serious embarrassment.  10. Revenge porn. The act of distributing or sharing sexually explicit photos or videos of a person without his/her consent online. Revenge porn is typically shared by a past sexual partner who aims to publically humiliate the victim. 11. Cyberstalking. An extremely dangerous form of harassment that can lead to physical harassment in the real world. What can you do about cyberbullying?Preparation is as important as education when it comes to cyberbullying. In many cyberbullying cases, decisive legal action must be taken to stop the abuse and bring the perpetrators to justice because this process\"s emotional and financial implications can be devastating.Other ways you can stop cyberbullying include:Block the bully. Use the blocking system on the social media platform to prevent them from sending any harmful messages.Report the abuse. Many social media platforms have a mechanism in place to address abuse and bullying. This way, the bully can be stopped by being blocked or banned from the platform altogether.Keep evidence. Don’t be tempted to delete abusive messages or images. Keep a record of it in case you need to lodge a formal complaint with the authorities or take legal action. What is cyber insurance? Cyber security insurance provides protection against losses and damages from cyber incidents, like data breaches, hacking attacks, and other types of cybercrime. This type of insurance applies to business and personal use. So, if you’re wondering, ‘do I need cyber insurance,’ the answer is a resounding ‘yes.’This is due to the fact that the frequency and severity of cyber incidents have increased exponentially. We have also become an online culture with most work operations, along with entertainment, banking and shopping, all being conducted online. Many businesses, organisations, and people in their private capacities have opted to protect themselves with cyber insurance.  What does a cyber insurance policy cover?The cover will include expenses for legal fees, as well as the costs incurred from restoring or replacing lost or stolen data. It includes cover for first-party data loss, data restoration costs, business interruption and third-party losses. Some policies will include cover for reputational damage following a cyber attack event.  Get cyber insurance and protect your loved onesFirst for Women offers cyber insurance that covers cyberbullying. This includes unlimited legal advice, mediation, and R55,000 litigation benefits. Get a quote online and keep yourself and your family safe from the growing threat of online bullying and cyber attacks.

        "heading": "How Drunk Driving Can Affect Your Car Insurance",
        "description": "",
        "content": "The National Road Traffic Amendment Bill[1] was introduced to Parliament in May 2020. The legislation takes a hard line on drunk driving. The rule sets zero tolerance for blood alcohol if you are behind the wheel. Discover how this can affect you should you make a car insurance claim and were involved in a drink-and-drive situation. What does the law say about drunk driving? The current National Road Traffic Act  allows drivers to get behind the wheel after consuming alcohol, provided they are below the blood alcohol limit. When measured with a breathalyser, non-professional drivers’ blood alcohol must measure below 0.24 milligrams per 1 000 milligrams. Professionals, like truck drivers and others who hold professional driving permits, must have less than 0.10 milligrams per 1 000 milligrams on testing.The new limits were set to reduce these boundaries to less than 0.05 grams per 100 millilitres for normal drivers and less than 0.02 grams per 100 millilitres for professionals when measured using a blood sample. Although the bill alters the rules regarding blood alcohol levels, other parts of the act that deal with driving under the influence – such as the methods of testing or penalties – remain unchanged. Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, announced that ‘research conducted by the RTMC [Road Traffic Management Corporation] in collaboration with the South African Medical Research Council and the University of South Africa shows that driver alcohol intoxication accounts for 27.1% of fatal crashes in the country’.[2]In addition, Arrive Alive reports that ‘research indicates that 50% of people who die on the roads have a blood alcohol concentration above 0.05 gram per 100 millilitres.[3]With these statistics, it’s somewhat unsurprising that the government is taking a firm stance against drunk driving. Why does drunk driving affect car insurance? The new rules will affect your relationship with the law and car insurance – and for a good reason. Find out more. Alcohol affects your driving abilitySafe driving requires whoever is operating the vehicle to be alert and able to make split-second decisions in rapidly changing situations. Despite these well-known facts, many people do not hesitate to get behind the wheel after consuming alcohol. Although you may feel fine after one or two glasses of wine, alcohol substantially impacts your driving ability.Drinking slows your response time, increasing the likelihood of a road accident. And it’s no wonder how regularly and swiftly road conditions change. Just 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood add 13% to a driver’s reaction time. So if you’re driving and the car ahead of you brakes suddenly, it will take your brain 13% longer to process what’s going on and prompt you to hit the brakes yourself, creating danger for yourself and other road users.Besides reducing the likelihood that you’ll see a potential hazard, delayed reaction times also increase drivers’ tendency to become distracted. Alcohol makes your mind less focused, causing you to be less vigilant behind the wheel. When driving, this can affect your ability to stay in your lane, regulate your speed, and heed road traffic signals.Not only do you have to be aware of what’s happening on the road around you, but you also need to change gears, signal turns and steer. Drunk driving affects your motor skills, including eye, hand and foot coordination, which inhibits your ability to perform these tasks. Signs of reduced coordination, like swaying or the inability to grasp onto objects, make it difficult – and dangerous – to operate a vehicle. Add to this the fact that it blurs vision, reduces the ability to control eye movement and hinders peripheral vision, and it’s easy to see why it’s a terrible idea to drink and drive. How is alcohol metabolised?Although it typically takes a couple of hours to break down the amount of alcohol in a single serving of wine, a variety of factors affect how quickly the body metabolises alcohol.For one, the rate you consume alcohol will affect how your body absorbs it. The more you consume in a shorter period, the longer your body will metabolise what you drink. Downing large amounts overtax your body’s ability to absorb and break down the alcohol, forcing your system to shut down. This is when you start to see effects such as lowered inhibitions, reduced motor function, and slurred speech. Popular drinks like wine, cider, and beer have a high acid content that can cause your digestive system to become irritated when you drink without eating. Without any ‘lining’ to occupy your gut, your body will absorb the alcohol more rapidly, causing the effects to take hold more quickly. The same is true for women.Women are far more susceptible to the effects of alcohol than men. First, weight impacts how alcohol is metabolised as it influences the space in which liquor can diffuse through the body. As a result, a person who weighs more will likely have a lower concentration of alcohol in their blood from drinking the same amount as a lighter person. As women often weigh less than men, the effects of alcohol are usually more pronounced in ladies.Additionally, women’s bodies contain proportionately less water and more fat than men’s. Because fat retains alcohol, drinking exposes the organs to higher concentrations of alcohol for longer periods of time. A woman’s body also produces less alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, which breaks down alcohol before it reaches the bloodstream. Consequently, at the same dosage size, a woman’s blood alcohol level will be higher than a man’s, regardless of differences in body weight or fat percentage. The effect? Moderate drinking for a man borders on heavy drinking for a woman; you can expect alcohol to have roughly double the effect on women as it does on men. How much alcohol can I drink?Typically, our bodies metabolise alcohol at a rate of 15 grams per 100 millilitres per hour. This means it will take two hours for a blood alcohol level of 0.02 to reduce to zero. The table below provides a quick overview of approximate timeframes for metabolising different drinks.Type of alcoholic beverageAverage time to metabolise30 ml of whiskey or similar1 hour500 ml of beer2 hours250 ml glass of wine3 hours Looking at these rates, it’s clear that a sober approach is best if you’re getting behind the wheel. You want to stay on the right side of the law – and your car insurance policy.How drunk driving affects car insurance claimsBesides criminalising drinking and driving, the National Road Traffic Amendment Bill will have a significant effect on your car insurance.If you’re under the influence of alcohol while driving a vehicle and are involved in an accident, your insurance provider may legally refuse to honour your car insurance claim. Aside from having the legal right to refuse claims where a driver acts illegally, almost all car insurance companies in South Africa include a clause to this effect in their policies. You could also be met with higher premiums. Or worse, your insurer may choose to cancel your policy.It’s best to adopt a few zero-tolerance tactics that will help to keep you in the driver’s seat and insured.

        "content": "It&rsquo;s natural to want to cut down on expenses in tough times. From scaling back your spending on luxuries, like eating out and getting your nails done, to trimming down when you spend on groceries, it makes sense to be frugal. Although not knowing what&rsquo;s coming next can trigger fear and tempt us to eliminate expenses that don&rsquo;t keep the lights on or our families\" stomachs full. Like car insurance from First for Women. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s essential that you don&rsquo;t let fear take over and compromise your long-term security - even when uncertainty looms.While there are many things that are constantly outside of our control, tough times create a heightened sense of the volatility around us. This can be a source of stress, provoking panic and leading to anxiety. But focusing on what you can control, which is to insure a car so that your vehicle and family are protected while you&rsquo;re on the road, will help you meet uncertainty with confidence and composure. Keep reading our guide about how to insure a car in tough times. First for Women car insurance tips for keeping your premiums low1. Shop around and compare car insurance quotesIt might be easy to get a single car insurance quote and sign up immediately, but shopping around for car insurance is the best way to ensure that you get a fair rate. It also puts you in a position where you can compare a car insurance quote and choose a plan that best suits your needs. While insurers offer various benefits to make them stand out in the market, some of these might not necessarily suit your lifestyle. This means that you could end up paying for a service that doesn&rsquo;t provide any real rewards for you. What can you do about it? First for Women advises that a good rule of thumb when it comes to comparing different insurers and insurance packages is to get three quotes. This will help you to establish whether the rates you&rsquo;re offered are fair and in line with market standards and could even give you some wiggle room for negotiation. 2. Bundle your insurance policiesBut shopping around shouldn&rsquo;t just be reserved for when you want to insure a car. If you&rsquo;re looking to save even more on monthly premiums or if your financial circumstances have changed, comparing insurance quotes will help you take control of your cover and your finances. If you have car, home contents, buildings and life cover insurance with different providers, you may be paying too much for different policies. It&rsquo;s a good idea to find out how consolidating these policies could affect your insurance costs. You may even want to look into insurance specifically designed for women to help you take charge in tough times.  3. Get the right kind of car insurance coverInstead of canceling your car insurance cover altogether, you can take a closer look at the type of cover you have, especially if you need cheap car insurance given your financial circumstances.  Being without any auto insurance can have serious financial consequences if you find yourself in a situation where your vehicle is damaged or stolen. Unfortunately, accidents happen and the possibility of a collision is never predictable. Even if you take every precaution to avoid being involved in an accident while on the road, another driver could crash into you. To exacerbate the problem, about 70% of vehicles on South African roads are uninsured.[1] This means that it&rsquo;s highly likely the other driver won&rsquo;t have insurance to cover any damages, which could leave you financially and legally exposed. What&rsquo;s more, incidents like theft or hijacking can rob you of your vehicle and the freedom it gives you. Whether you&rsquo;re taking out insurance on a new vehicle or looking to save on your cover, understanding the different types of vehicle insurance available will empower you to decide what best suits your needs and your budget. Let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the different types of First for Women car insurance options:Comprehensive insuranceComprehensive car insurance is an all-inclusive car insurance cover that covers your vehicle in the event of theft, loss and accidental or fire damage or write off. You will usually have to take comprehensive insurance if you&rsquo;ve taken out finance on a new car. This extensive protection includes cover in case of damage caused by adverse weather conditions, like hail or flooding if hail cover is chosen and paid for as part of your policy. It will also payout for any third-party damages if you are responsible for the accident and need to repair the other vehicle. Although this is the ideal type of car insurance, it is the most expensive. Third-party, fire and theft insuranceAs the name suggests, third-party, fire and theft car insurance covers loss or damage arising to another driver&rsquo;s car where you are responsible for an accident, and where your car is damaged due to a fire or is lost due to theft. This type of cover does not include protection for accidental damage to your own vehicle. Although it provides less cover than comprehensive car insurance, the advantage of third-party, fire and theft car insurance - sometimes known as liability insurance - is the lower monthly premium it costs to insure a car. Third-party insuranceThe most limited form of car insurance, third-party car insurance only covers damage you may cause to another driver&rsquo;s car in the event of an accident. Although third-party insurance is the cheapest car insurance available and protects you from potentially devastating financial implications of a collision, it must be noted that your own vehicle is not covered when you insure a car under this type of cover.First for Women Essentials CoverThis type of car insurance cover is a non-comprehensive cover, like third-party, fire and theft, and third-party only, which means there are some limits to your vehicle cover. There are three types to choose from:First for Women Essential 1-Up to R1 Million third-party cover-Your vehicle is covered if it is stolenFirst for Women Essential 2-Up to R1 million third-party cover-Your vehicle is covered if it is written off or stolen-Hail cover-Accident Assist includes towing from the scene of the accident and storage of the vehicleFirst for Women Essential 3-Up to R1 million third-party cover-Your vehicle is covered if it is written off or stolen-Hail cover-Accident Assist includes towing from the scene of the accident and storage of the vehicle-Limited accident cover up to R15,0004. Read the fine print on your car insurance policyAlthough aggregation sites and online quotes make a broad comparison of different insurers and insurance packages easy, they don&rsquo;t necessarily provide detailed information about exactly what is offered and expected. Understanding the activation costs, additional fees, excess structure and exclusions, as well as the responsibilities that lie with you, will prevent any unwelcome surprises when it comes time to pay your car insurance premium or submit an auto claim. 5. Learn how to manage your risk profileDid you know that women usually pay lower car insurance premiums than men? Your car insurance premium is based on your risk profile, which indicates how likely you are to claim. A variety of factors are taken into consideration when drawing up your risk profile, including the value of your vehicle, your age, and your physical address, among others.While there are a few factors that you can&rsquo;t control, there are others that can be managed to keep your insurance costs down when you insure a car. For instance, fitting your car with a security system and tracking device will reduce the risk of theft, reducing the risk for your insurer and your premium. 6. Balance your premiums and excessExcess is the fixed amount you have to pay if you make an auto insurance claim. This fee is designed to discourage low-value claims as well as fraudulent claims and is payable regardless of who is responsible for the damage, loss or theft. There are usually two types of excess: compulsory and voluntary. The first is decided by your insurer, while the second is set by you. If you&rsquo;re a vigilant driver with a good claims history, choosing to pay a higher excess than what is required by your insurer is a great way to reduce your monthly premiums. However, it&rsquo;s important to make sure you&rsquo;ll be able to afford the fee if you are involved in an accident.

        "heading": "Fact or Fiction: Women Pay Lower Car Insurance Premiums than Men?",
        "description": "",
        "content": "For as long as cars have existed, jokes have been made about women drivers. But like many maxims, they’re not backed up by facts. In fact, the research shows something vastly different; over and over, women outperform men in many areas of driving. That’s one of the reasons why at First for Women, we offer car insurance plans that are designed exclusively for women. This means women generally do pay lower premiums than men do. Find out why this is happeningWhy do women pay less for car insurance premiums?In order to answer this burning question, let’s take a look at this issue in more detail - because who doesn’t love facts and research to back up something we already know.2 Reason that allows women to pay less for car insuranceThere are two important reasons why women can enjoy a lower premium on their car insurance plans.1. Women are better drivers than menIt’s not just South African women who pay lower car insurance premiums. Research from all over the world backs up the notion that statistically, women drive better than men. It shows us it’s about more than technical skills. It’s also about the behavioural and neurological reasons behind the discrepancies in women’s and men’s driving styles that matters when it comes to assessing insurance risk.2. Women are safer drivers than menStudies have shown that men drive more aggressively and recklessly than women, which makes them a greater insurance risk. They are more likely to get behind the wheel after having a few drinks and they tend to drive more, which automatically makes them riskier to insure. Women, in contrast, tend to be more cautious on the road and are better at obeying traffic laws. They speed less and don’t skip stop signs as often. A report published by the Social Issue Research Centre (SIRC) showed that the most aggressive drivers are men between the ages of 17 and 35 years old. They are three times quicker to hoot if the driver in front of them is slow to move at a green robot, and they are more likely to have an accident because of reckless driving. Compare this to women, who are more likely to have an accident because of a lapse in concentration, and so are less likely to file a car insurance claim.How does gender affect insurance rates, and is this fair?You might be wondering if, despite all this evidence that women are safer drivers, it’s fair to base insurance premiums on a person’s gender. This depends on who you ask. It is seen as discriminatory by some. Indeed, in the European Union, the practice of basing insurance rates on gender was outlawed in 2012.The reality though, is that it can be argued that many factors used to determine a person’s insurance premium would be ‘unfair’. In addition to your gender, insurance companies also look at your age, where you live, where you work, whether you’re married, and even your credit history. Perhaps some of these factors are unfair, but no more so than a person’s gender.There is also the infamous pink tax that women have to face every day. We’re not saying two wrongs make a right, but if you want to argue that gender-based insurance premiums aren’t fair, then we should look at all the items where women’s products are priced higher than men’s, usually for much more arbitrary reasons. Home, beauty, kids and adults clothing, and children’s toys are just some of the products women are frequently charged more for with no or little apparent difference between the men’s and women’s products.What do insurers look at when quoting for car insurance?It isn’t just about your gender. There are a number of other factors that your insurer will consider when providing a quote on car insurance. Here are some of the other factors that will be taken into consideration:1. Your demographics:Age. Drivers under 25 years old are considered a higher risk for some of the same reasons men are - younger people are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviour.Home address. If you stay in a high-crime rate area, your car is more likely to be stolen or damaged. If your area is relatively crime-free, on the other hand, your insurance premium is likely to be lower.Work address. If you spend most of your waking life at your job so does your car. It makes sense that we’d need to know where your place of work is located.Where you park. Whether at home or the office, where you park your car makes a difference. Leaving your car on the street overnight puts it at a higher risk for theft and damage than in an access-controlled, underground garage.2. The type of car you driveThe type of vehicle you drive has a major effect on your premiums. While we know you’re less likely to get into an accident than your male counterparts, we understand that mishaps do happen. That’s why we look at how much it might cost, on average, to repair your car if it’s damaged. We also take its safety features into account and any after-factory add-ons you might have included, like a sound system.3. What your job involves It’s not just where you park your car that matters, it’s what you with your car. Your occupation matters to insurers. Estate agents, sales reps, and tradesmen who are often on the road and who visit office blocks or private homes could pay more for cover. These might seem like a strange mix of professionals, but some jobs require that you be on the road. This makes it a higher risk to insure.4. Your driving history We know that most women are responsible drivers. Unfortunately, accidents do happen. When they do, it can affect your premiums for a while afterwards. So, your insurer will need to know what accidents you’ve had in recent years so we can assess how likely you are to have another one.The reason why First for Women only insures female driversFirst for Women has provided women with top-quality car insurance in South Africa for over 15 years. We wanted to provide insurance that was designed specifically for women. Even now, with other insurance products for women available, we feel it’s still important for us to create cover exclusively for women.

        "content": "It Is possible to buy a rental car. Yes, it is possible, and many people do buy rental cars.  There is a wide selection of cars available from manufacturers and models on sale at reduced prices that range from hatchbacks to sedans, SUVs and 4x4s. Expect to find popular models, like the Toyota Corolla Quest, VW Polo Vivo, Kia Picanto, and Etios. First for Women takes a closer look at the advantages of buying a used car from a rental company. Discover how to buy a rental car with these car insurance tips and insights.Car insurance tips: is it a good idea to buy a rental car? Rental cars account for 15% of vehicle sales in South Africa[1] - a fair volume of sales, and it’s no wonder. Buying a rental car is worth it, and that is because car rental companies offer quite a bit of security. Car rental companies build their fleet and maintain an up-to-date inventory by regularly selling off their older car models to purchase new vehicles. Plus, buying a well-known and trusted car brand means that the vehicle will retain its value over time and reduce the cost of owning the car in the long term. How to buy a used carMore often than not, most car rental companies\" sales websites allow you to search for their used cars for sale by make, model, year, mileage and colour. You can even use the price lever, which will help you narrow down your options and save time. Benefits of buying a used carThere are several benefits to buying a used car, some of these include the following: 1. Lower car pricesNegotiating car prices could be seen as either a good or a bad thing, depending on your personality and your negotiating skills. Either way, rental cars are usually priced below market value, as car rental companies want to move them off the floor quickly.  It’s important to note that should you want to resell your car down the line, it will have a lower resale value when compared to a car with only one previous owner. 2. Well maintainedIt may be a perception that car hirers don’t drive a rental car as carefully as they would their own car, but this may not be completely true because damages to a rental car are paid for by the hirer. Many rental cars have been well maintained with regular cleans and checks because it is in the rental company’s best interest to keep their fleet in top-notch condition.3. Affordable finance optionsIn the same way that new and second-hand car dealerships will, most car rental companies can provide you with financing options through accredited South African financial service providers. 4. 30-day exchangesSome car rental companies, like Avis, offer a 30-day exchange plan should you not be satisfied with the mechanical condition of the car you have purchased. In this case, they will replace it with a similar one or one that is within the same price range. First for Women tips for buying a rental car Check the mileage - rental cars tend to have more mileage on the odometer than a typical used car of the same age. However, most rental cars that are for sale are less than two years old and have around 100,000km on the clock. If a car is a little older, choose the one with the lowest mileage. Confirm ownership - ask for proof that the car has been bought directly from the manufacturer.Look at the service history - make sure the car comes with a full-service history report. If there’s a drop in the documented mileage between one service and the next, for instance, this could be a reason for concern. Check the service plans intervals - a failure to adhere to the regularly scheduled service may make a warranty invalid. Double-check this with the car manufacturer. Opt for an extended warranty - ask if there is an option to extend the car warranty through an accredited third-party insurance provider, like First for Women. Confirm any accidents - ask the rental company for detailed records of all incidents that have occurred involving the car, as previous damage repairs may affect the residual value of the vehicle. Consider a trade-in - if you’re replacing it with an existing car, some car rental companies may be open to a trade-in to help sweeten the deal. Can you get car insurance for a used car?Yes, it is possible to get second-hand car insurance. First for Women recommend getting car insurance for your vehicle, regardless of whether it is brand new or a used car. Rental car insurance is also an option available for drivers who plan on renting a car for a set amount of time.

        "content": "Now that summer is on the way South Africans are all itching to hit the open road, go on holiday, take day trips, or just catch up with friends and family. Perhaps you’ve been itching to buy a new car for a while but just haven’t been sure.The state of brand-new carsIf you plan to buy a brand-new car, it might be a tad more difficult to get exactly what you want right now. The South African car market has seen quite a shake-up during the Covid-19 crisis with vehicle manufacturers being forced to close for the first few months of the lockdown.In short, this means you might not be able to get the car you want because production has been impacted resulting in low stock of certain car brands. In June, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) said it expected a drop of 25% in the production, sale, and export of new vehicles in and from South Africa. Its CEO Mike Mabasa told Engineering Newsthat “Covid-19 will have a major impact on the rest of the year”. This doesn’t mean that there are no new cars available, but you may have to look a bit harder for what you want or be willing to compromise. Great deals on a used carsIf you can’t find a new version of the make and model you want, why not search the pre-owned car market? Asif Hoosen, the head of sales at Audi South Africa confirmed in an interview with iol.co.za that there is value in buying a premium used car now. According to him, pre-owned cars offer “the best bang for your buck in terms of what you’re going to get for the price compared to a new car”.TheTransUnion SA Vehicle Pricing Index (VPI) showed that buyers have been favouring used over new cars since lockdown restrictions were relaxed. This can be attributed to buyers realising they can get a good deal, or may be a result of the widespread loss of income caused by the lockdown. Either way, the VPI found that 33% of vehicles sold were under two years old, which means you may be able to find a used car that’s as good as new!TransUnion’s head of auto information solutions, Kriben Reddy, toldTimesLive that the cost of car ownership is declining and that buyers were increasingly choosing to buy pre-loved or lower-end new vehicles. “For many consumers this is more than adequate and it is not necessary to look any higher up. Buying a lower-end vehicle means less monthly instalments, less in maintenance and running costs and most likely more affordable insurance premiums,” he said. Low interest ratesIn response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated economic hardships, the South African Reserve Bank cut the repo rate twice since March. This resulted in a significant decrease in the interest rates paid by customers. This gives you one of two advantages:You can buy a slightly more expensive car than you originally planned, at the same instalment rate. Or you can buy the same car you were hoping to buy, but at a lower instalment than you would have paid before the pandemic. The National Automobile Dealers’ Association (NADA) said it hoped the Reserve Bank would keep interest rates low for at least the next two years.Tips for new car buyersIf you decide to scratch the itch and go for it, there are a few things to keep in mind:Budget properly: Don’t forget car insurance is mandatory for financed vehicles.Be flexible: The more flexible you are the more likely you’ll find a good deal. Cast a wide net: Shop around but make sure that you look at reputable dealers only.Test drive: Get a feel of whether it is a good fit for you and be 100% satisfied.Get the best deal: Ask questions and don’t be afraid to negotiate a better deal.Sleep on it: Take your time. Don’t be too hasty to sign the deal.Be patient: If you do prefer a brand new car, wait until the production of cars catch up Some dealerships require that you make an appointment beforehand, so check their website or give them a call before heading out. In many cases, a large part of the buying process can be done online, including applications for financing. So is it a good time to buy a used car? That depends on you and your situation. But if you have the means and need a car for practical and leisure use, then the surplus of relatively new pre-owned cars and slashed interest rates could mean opportunities for a good deal!Disclaimer: This content is for informational, educational, or entertainment purposes only.

Why is buildings insurance so important?Building insurance cover is important because it provides financial protection against loss and damage caused by the elements and people, deliberately or accidentally.

In this way, property owners have been of mind knowing that their home is covered financially in case of unforeseen disaster or circumstances.

How to compare building insurance When deciding on the best cover for your home, we suggest that you compare at least three different insurers based on the following factors:Pricing: When it comes to insurance, we are always tempted to opt for the lowest premium value, but experts advise that going for the lowest premium may mean compromising on the cover. Value for money: Find out what each insurance company will cover. This includes the rand value and the type of damage for which your home is covered. Some cover types need to be supplemented because they don’t cover things like burst geysers, or flooding. You don’t want to find yourself paying for insurance only to find out that you’re not covered for that particular event if you need to claim. Ensure you understand what’s included and what’s excluded before deciding on a policy.Reviews and recommendations: What other customers say about the service and their claims experience with each insurer should tell you a lot about what you can expect if you sign up as their customer. Go online, read some independent reviews, talk to your homeowner friends about their insurer and see which company will suit you from a customer expectation perspective.Excesses: You also need to consider what excesses are involved when you need to claim, what the respective excess amounts are and if you are prepared and able to cover these amounts from your own pocket in the event that you need to make a claim. Insuring with your bank? If your bank currently covers your home building insurance, or if you’re buying a new home, don’t let the bank or the institute you’re taking your bond with force you into taking their option. Always compare building insurance with the other options out there to ensure you are getting value for money and that your home is in good hands.When you compare, you get to see what options are available for you, and you’re equipped with the right information, enabling you to make a more informed decision.Get a building insurance quote from First for Women With 1st for Women’s comprehensive buildings insurance cover we have designed it specifically for women\"s and women’s needs at the perfect price point.

        "content": "We know you always like to be prepared. That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ve got insurance policies, you always pay your premiums and you know what to do when you claim. But what about your family? Are they prepared? As the beneficiaries of your policies, they need to know how to claim if you pass away or are unable to claim yourself.With so many beneficiaries unaware of the claims process, there are billions of Rands in unclaimed benefits in South Africa from numerous policies, including life insurance. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so crucial that they know what to do &ndash; to reduce the financial and emotional burden of not receiving a pay-out.So, to make it easy for you, and them, we&rsquo;ve put together a step-by-step guide on how to claim. Here goes:First things first &ndash; tell your family and beneficiaries what policies you have and what each one covers Too often families are left with the admin nightmare of sorting through paperwork, emails and folders in order to claim or finalise their loved one&rsquo;s estates. So, to relieve that unnecessary pressure, tell them about all the policies you have, such as:Life coverFuneral insuranceDisability insuranceDread disease coverGroup benefits with employerPension funds and retirement annuitiesInvestmentsMedical coverEnsure they know what each policy covers (e.g. death or a critical illness) so that they know when to claim and from which policy.Usually families only need to claim on a Life or funeral policy. But there are other instances that may require them to claim e.g. if you are critically ill or unconscious and can&rsquo;t make a claim yourself on a disability or dread disease policy.VERY IMPORTANT: Ensure that your family is fully aware of any exclusions or waiting periods on your policy, which you can find on your policy schedule. Ensure your family, beneficiaries, advisor or attorney know where you keep your policies Whether they&rsquo;re saved in hard copy, in the cloud, or anywhere else, ensure that all relevant parties know exactly where they are and if you change where you keep these, let them know. If documents are saved digitally, ensure that they have access rights to these files.Helpful tip: Complete a claims instruction sheet for each policyThink of this as a cheat sheet for each policy that includes the policy number, contact details for the relevant claims department and other important details.Take them through the claims process Firstly, to help save time, ensure the right person lodges the claims. Here&rsquo;s a list of who should claim on which policy:Life policy: The beneficiaries named in the policyFuneral policy: The beneficiary named if the principal member passes on, or the principal member if an additional member passes awayDisability and Dread disease policies: The life assured or a family member if the life assured is unable toWhile our Claims Team will be there to assist your family with anything they need, it&rsquo;s a good idea to prepare some of the documents and details e.g. the policy number and original or certified copies of your ID. If the claim is due to be paid to a beneficiary, we&rsquo;ll also need their bank account and ID number.Some documents requested will depend on the specific claim e.g. doctors&rsquo; and specialists&rsquo; reports. All your family needs to do is get in touch with us to find out what&rsquo;s required. With that said, we try to keep the paperwork to a minimum and pay claims as quickly as we can &ndash; to alleviate administrative and financial stress.Let your family know why you took out the policy and how you&rsquo;d like the money from a claim to be spentThis is a very personal decision. You may take a life policy so that your bond will be paid off or your children&rsquo;s education will be covered. You may also decide that you want the pay-out to be invested for an income.Knowing that funeral costs may be expensive, it&rsquo;s also a good idea to specify how you&rsquo;d like them to use your funeral policy pay-out to avoid overspending.Update your family on any policy changes As time goes on, you may decide to increase your cover, add or remove a beneficiary or take out an additional benefit such as disability cover. Keep your family and beneficiaries updated so they know who can claim, and under what circumstances.Schedule an annual check-inGo through the checklist above with your beneficiaries and family once a year to refresh everyone&rsquo;s memory. This will give you peace of mind that should anything happen to you, everyone knows what to do."

        "content": " We all love a good deal: A designer handbag at a great discount, aeroplane tickets at lower-than-normal cost, and negotiating down the price and feeling proud of our bargaining skills. Unfortunately, when it comes to cheap car insurance, this is one place a bargain could actually hurt rather than help. At First for Women, our goal is to make sure you&rsquo;re getting the best car insurance for your budget, and we&rsquo;ll help you find a policy that works for you.Why cheap car insurance isn&rsquo;t always the best optionWhen it comes to cheap car insurance, there is a very low price tag attached.

You may find that your cheap car insurance policy will be of little help to you when you need it if you ever find yourself in the unfortunate situation of needing to make a car insurance claim.You can still get good car insurance without spending a fortune, and First for Women can help.5 Dangers of cheap car insuranceHere are some of the main reasons why you never want to cut corners.Less money equals less cover. Does your cheap car insurance policy cover theft, damage, dents, or roadside assistance? Often, the policyholder is left to bear the cost of incidents and accidents.Poor customer service. Accidents happen at inconvenient times, and you want to know that if you call your insurance company in the middle of the night for roadside assistance, someone will be there for you. This is unlikely to be the case when all you have is a poor insurance policy at low rates.Higher excess. Cheap car insurance an offer such low costs because many low-cost policies will drive the excess way up. This means that the amount you contribute to any claim is much higher than good quality insurance cover. Before signing a policy, we advise that you make sure you are aware of the excess rates and that you can afford them.Uninsured for certain areas. You should understand the full scope of the coverage and any fine print about which repair shops can handle your car insurance claims, which companies are approved for roadside assistance, and more.

Reputable companies like First for Women offer fast claims processing and work with you after an accident or claim to ensure you have what you need to get back on the road quickly and safely. Often, cheap insurance companies will fail to do so and are unlikely to offer any of the value or benefits that go with service excellence.The benefits of comprehensive car insuranceNow that you understand the dangers of cheap car insurance, it&rsquo;s time to start thinking about the best car insurance plan for your vehicle. A comprehensive car insurance plan is one of the best options on the market.

        "content": "You insure your car, home, and take out a life insurance policy, but did you know you can get a pet insurance policy? As a pet parent (or pawrent, if you will) to a fur baby, it\"s easy to understand animals\" important role in family dynamics. At First for Women, we know that pets are family, too. This is why our pet insurance plan is designed to help with medical expenses, routine care, hospital stays, transportation, and more. Pick one of three pet insurance plans that fit your budget and needs today and get started protecting your furry family members.  What is pet insurance?Pet insurance is an insurance policy that helps decrease the overall costs of veterinary bills, with coverage similar to health insurance policies for humans. It not only gives you peace of mind but protects your finances against unexpected bills. *Did you know that one in three pets require emergency medical care at least once in their life? Because pet insurance doesn’t cover pre-existing conditions, it’s best to purchase a policy before medical issues arise. Perhaps this is why pet insurance is on the rise in South Africa.Did you know that beyond a cat or a dog, the pet insurance plans at First for Women will also provide other animal insurance, just ask our consultants if your pet is on the list of animals, fish or reptiles that we cover.Here’s how First for Women’s pet insurance policy works:When your pet is ill or needs specific veterinary care, you take them to the veterinarian and pay the bill out of pocket. You then claim back once you’ve settled with the veterinary practice. The process of making an out of pocket claim is straightforward. Typically, your claim is a portion or percentage of the bill.How is pet insurance different from pet medical aid?Pet insurance and medical aid cover the different medical needs of your pet. Common visits and minor treatments fall under the medical aid umbrella, while pet insurance is there to step in when bigger medical issues occur, like a much-need operation. At First for Women, our top to tail classic and premium paws plans both offer some cover for routine wellness checkups and minor care needs.Why it’s a good idea to get pet insurancePet ownership is rewarding but it can also be an expensive experience. Sterilisation, deworming, regular checkups, and flea and tick medicine all add up over time. With pet insurance, you can offset some of these costs—along with unexpected events, like a broken leg or surgery. It would be heartbreaking to be in the unfortunate position where you are unable to afford the care necessary to save your pet\"s life when insurance could have helped.What you can expect to pay for vet bills in South AfricaExpected and unexpected costs might include R500 for vaccinations, R6,000 for x-rays, and R2,500 for sterilisation and deworming. These costs are some of the reasons why animal insurance, especially dog insurance, is becoming increasingly popular in the country. The First for Women pet insurance policy covers you for up to R150,000 for your pets (terms &amp; conditions apply).Will a pet insurance plan cover everything?Pet Insurance covers certain aspects of the vet’s bill. First for Women’s three pet insurance plans include basic, comprehensive, and premium options. Each of these plans covers events like in-hospital care and post-surgery care, allowing you to focus on your pet and their well-being instead of stressing about paying their bills. Other benefits include:a pet taxi to chauffeur your pet to and from the veterinary clinicAccess to Vet@First, our 24/7 dedicated healthcare line for professional emergency and medical advice for pet health.The First for Women benefits have no waiting periods for accident claims, including accidental death or for dignified ‘furwells’. Illness, wellness, minor care, and diagnostics have a 30-day waiting period, while there is a six month waiting period for death due to natural causes, like old age. Congenital and hereditary conditions carry a one-year waiting period. Our policyholders never pay excess for wellness, dignified ‘furwell’, and third party liability claims.There are pet health-related items that aren’t covered, and it’s important to understand the limitations. Exclusions include pre-existing conditions and, if you choose the fur baby basic plan, congenital or hereditary conditions are also excluded. It’s important to have a good understanding of your pet’s medical needs before choosing a policy.How much does pet insurance cost?First for Women has three levels of pet insurance available for pet owners in South Africa: fur baby basic, top to tail classic, and premium paws. There are a number of factors that contribute to the pet insurance prices but plans for cats and dogs start at R100 per month.

The telephone consultation can look at a variety of topics, including finance and tax matters. A tax attorney can answer questions related to income tax returns, calculate taxes payable, understand your deductions, and how to best plan for your retirement.Beyond a tax assist, other legal matters provided by the service include:Legal documentation around buying or selling a homePower of attorney agreementsWills and contracts,Courtroom preparation,Contractual lawLegal representation referral.Legal Assist is not the same as Legal Aid, which is a free South African legal service given to those who can’t afford legal representation.How Legal Assist can help you with legal queriesHiring an attorney is something almost everyone will have to do at least once in their lifetime, but that doesn’t mean it should be a financial drain. Our service provides expert opinions and, if needed, gives a referral upon request. Some of the ways you can make use of the Legal Assist benefit are listed below.1. Documents needed for buying or selling a house or propertyCongratulations! You bought or sold your home. This milestone is often the first time many people need a law assist guide for help. You will need to choose between an attorney or a conveyancer to sell or buy a house. Transferring a title, finalising closing paperwork, paying the fees involved with the sale transfer, and other steps and negotiations along the way are all documents that require an attorney. Whatever your sale or purchase requires, our team is ready to help.2. Leases and rental agreementsWhether you’re a landlord managing property or a renter looking to move, you’ll have to sign a lease or rental agreement. Often, the terms lease agreement and rental agreement are used interchangeably to mean the same thing. While they do vary slightly, the core of each agreement is the same: both are binding legal contracts between the property owner and property renter.A lease agreement allocates a fixed time that a renter is allowed to live in a unit, typically six or 12 months. A rental agreement is typically issued for shorter periods.3. Personal willsWe’ve all seen the movie: a wealthy parent dies, and their children fight over assets, like real estate, jewellery, or even the family pet. Save the Hollywood drama for someone else and make sure you have a personal will, so your final wishes for your estate are actionable for your family and loved ones. You’ll need a lawyer to help you draft and execute a will—that’s the legal term for signing a will to make it legal. It’s not necessary to have your entire life and estate planned out before you begin the process of drafting a will, so reach out today to get the process started.4. Power of attorney agreementsPower of attorney affords legal authority to a designated person to act on behalf of another person in certain situations, such as a medical emergency. The person you choose to be a power of attorney is someone who is informed of your wishes and is a person you would feel comfortable speaking on your behalf if you’re unable to make important decisions yourself. For example, hospitals, doctors, insurance companies, and even banks may require a legal power of attorney document before allowing someone to access your personal information or make medical decisions on your behalf.

        "content": "If you own a car, the chances are high that you have car insurance. It’s a smart choice to protect your asset and ensure that you are covered in the case of a fender bender, or a more serious car accident in which someone is hurt. It’s also wise because your vehicle may fall victim to criminal activity – in 2019/2020, there were an estimated 88 000 incidences of motor vehicle theft in South Africa.1 But while we are all aware of the main reasons to get car insurance, many women do not realise that a good car insurance policy may also protect you from a variety of other risks.Insurance that makes your safety a priorityIf you’ve ever had a flat tyre in the middle of the night, a car that won’t start in a storm or a breakdown on a lonely road, you know that it is not just an inconvenience, it’s also downright terrifying. Suddenly you feel vulnerable and in danger, not knowing when help will arrive or if a passing stranger poses a threat to you.  Fortunately, most leading car insurance companies in South Africa provide a 24/7 Guardian Angel service during which time a representative of the company is sent to your location to wait with you until a qualified car mechanic is dispatched to fix your problem. Whether you are alone or with your kids, your safety should be a priority.  Also, a good insurance company will have an app or crash detection system that you can use so that if you’re involved in a serious car accident, you don’t even need to call in. The app or device will register the impact and alert the necessary medical and roadside authorities. Speed is often of the essence in providing healthcare to accident victims and insurance companies are working to ensure that you get the care you need as soon as possible.Insurance that aims to make your life easierIsn’t it always the case – when you’re really busy, that’s when Murphy’s Law strikes. And something that could go wrong, does go wrong.  But good car insurance could help you when you’re in a fix. Run out of fuel? They’ll bring you petrol or diesel to get you moving again.Hit a pothole and got a flat? They will come out and help change your tyres.Lost your keys? They will pay for you to get a new set.

Ensuring that there’s no risk of a flooded loo just before you have friends around for dinner! Depending on the type of car insurance that you have, you may even find that your car insurance gives you access to concierge services. This convenient service could help you book movie tickets, make restaurant reservations, or arrange a flight – ensuring that even your social life isn’t at risk.Insurance that expects the unexpectedWeather can be wonderful, or it can wild. But it is very rarely 100% predictable. You may not think too much about it, but bad weather and natural disasters can pose significant risks to you and your vehicle.  Hail, flooding, and fire can put your life at risk and damage your property. Your car insurance may offer you partial or full protection against these elemental challenges. Read your policy documents closely so that you’re informed and that these risks are clearly anticipated and managed.  And in the case that your car is badly damaged by inclement weather, rest easy knowing that your insurance company can pay for a tow truck to move it to a safer location and can pay for storage costs if those become necessary. That’s good news for your bank balance.ConclusionCars are the ultimate symbol of freedom and adventure – go where you want, when you want. And your perfect partner in that experience should be powerful car insurance that aims to take care of the details so you can concentrate on the journey.  Oh, and if the road is better with music, you can tailor your insurance to protect your sound system too.

        "content": "Having a baby is a milestone moment, a life-changing experience that brings new responsibilities. For many moms-to-be, the days and weeks before they give birth are filled with preparations for the arrival of their newest family member.  From cots and clothes, to bottles and bibs, there is a dazzling array of baby gear to consider and many decisions to be made.  While it may seem that baby&rsquo;s first car trip isn&rsquo;t as much of a priority before the child is born, if you are planning to drive your new-born baby anywhere in your car then you will need to consider buying a car seat as soon as possible. What the Law SaysIn South Africa, the National Road Traffic act stipulates that:Car seats for babies and young children under the age of 3 are compulsory. It is illegal to transport a child under the age of 3 in a vehicle if they are not strapped into a car seat and the car seat used must meet a minimum prescribed SABS standard. Any child between the ages of 3 and 14 must be wearing a car seat when the vehicle is in operation failing which the driver of the vehicle will be held liable.   Experts also strongly recommend that children under the age of 12, or under a height of 1.5m must be supported in a booster seat while travelling in a car to limit injury.  According to the Automobile Association of South Africa (AA):Car seats and boosters for infants and children should be placed on the back seat of the vehicle. Children under the age of 2 should be strapped into a rear-facing car seat and moved only to a front facing car seat as they get older. The AA also has a useful feature on its website where you can check the safety ratings of the car seat you are considering buying for your baby.  Why Car Seats for Children are ImportantLast year, the Road Traffic Management Corporation revealed that road traffic collisions are a leading cause of death and injuries for children under the age of 14 in South Africa and that in 2019, child deaths constituted 8% of the total number of road traffic fatalities in the country. And according to the American Academy of Paediatrics, in children younger than 1 year, using car seats decreases mortality by 71%.  Leading emergency medical service Netcare 911 also highlights that &ldquo;infants are especially at risk for head and spinal cord injuries because their bones and ligaments are still developing. Their heads are also proportionately larger than their necks as opposed to adults, so their structural support system is still a little wobbly.  There are two types of infant car seats, each with specific requirements for proper installation. When choosing your seat, remember that your baby&rsquo;s head and neck are most at risk, although it also doesn&rsquo;t take much to cause injury to any other part of the infant&rsquo;s body.&rdquo; Tips for Using a Car Seat Read the user manual carefully and follow the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions on how to install the car seat. If you can, it may be wise to consider having the car seat professionally installed. Any fault in the installation could render the car seat unsafe.It is preferable to not use a second-hand car seat unless you are sure that the seat is still properly operational and has been certified as safe for use by a reputable organisation. A second-hand car seat may look okay but you may not be able to see damage that would render the seat unsafe. Wherever possible, buy a new car seat from a speciality baby shop where you can be given good advice and assistance. There are many different types of car seats for infants and booster seats for children so ensure that you are getting the right seat for your baby/child&rsquo;s specific requirement such as age, height, and weight. While it may seem like an expensive exercise, it is a vital and necessary cost to ensure the safety of your child. Car seats should not be used in any space outside of a car as they may be unstable, may fall over, and may result in injury. Car seats are designed and engineered to work within a car environment only. When the car seat is being used in the car, ensure that all the harness straps are secure and fit your child snugly and that the car seat is properly tethered. Remove any bulky clothing that may impact how snugly your child is secured.It is advised that a baby stays no longer than two hours in a car seat and that long car trips are broken up with regular stops where the baby or child can be taken out of the car seat and allowed to stretch out.Never place a rear-facing car seat in front of an active passenger airbag. This can pose a grave threat to an infant. Disable or deactivate these airbags if this is the only place you can put the car seat. Best practice internationally is that a car seat should be placed on the backseat of the vehicle, where it is visible to the driver in the rear-view mirror. ConclusionCar seats are a positive and necessary investment to ensure the safety of your little one. In South Africa, organisations and initiatives such as Precious Cargo and #carseatfullstop aim to inform and educate. However, as the technology improves, and laws change it is imperative that parents and any other individuals driving infants and children do their research and due diligence to keep themselves updated on child car safety best practices.

        "content": "Your home contents are so much more than simple ‘things’ you put on display. They’re valuables that remind you of your most treasured memories, show your unique personality and turn a house into a home. First for Women are aware of just how devastating it can be to lose your treasured possessions, which is why our experts created a Home Insurance product designed specifically for women.Discover the benefits of a Home Insurance plan for your unique style – whether you need comprehensive home contents insurance or a simpler plan to protect your valuables from natural disasters or theft. Plus, our home insurance quotes include a generous feature - Handbag Cover - that protects your bag and everything you carry in it. Find out how household insurance works.What is home insurance &amp; how does it work?Home insurance or home contents insurance covers the cost of damage, repair or replacement of your household possessions against incidents like theft, fire, malicious damage, or destructive weather conditions.The benefits of home insurance with First for WomenOur household insurance cover is tailored with women in mind, which is why our benefits are geared towards some of the following:You get cover for yourself, your guests and your pets with our home contents insurance.We’ll pay out for food that spoils in your fridge or freezer during a power outage.Your First for Women house insurance will even replace your locks and keys after a break-in for the ultimate peace of mind.We offer choices. Choose from Comprehensive, or Fire and Storm Only Home Contents Insurance.If you do have a home emergency, remain at ease with our 24/7 Home Assist Benefit. First for Women will send a plumber, locksmith, glazier or electrician to your home to assist with the repair work.We provide Handbag Cover to the value of R5500 in our Comprehensive policies.Whether you’re entertaining guests or have a live-in domestic helper, you can rest assured that all their possessions are covered under your household insurance policy too.What exactly is covered under household insurance?Home contents insurance covers everything inside your house. If you had to take the roof off of your home, turn it upside down and give it a good shake, everything that falls out would be covered by contents insurance.At First for Women, we offer two levels of protection for your valuables:Comprehensive Home Contents Insurance Fire andStorm Only Home Contents InsuranceOur comprehensive option is extensive and covers all of your treasured belongings against almost any mishap or accident. The Fire and Storm Only Home Contents Insurance, on the other hand, will allow you to replace any valuables due to those completely unpredictable natural disasters and acts of nature. Understanding the specifics: what do over- and under-insurance terms mean?Neither of these scenarios is ideal, so it’s best to ensure you assess the value of your belongings properly when getting a home insurance quote.1. Over-insurance occurs where you insure your home contents for more than it would cost to replace them. In this case, you’ll pay a higher monthly premium than you would if your home contents were insured for the correct value. But that doesn’t mean that your insurer will pay out the amount for which you are insured. They will likely only pay the true value of the items that need replacing.2. Under-insured. If you insure your treasured belongings for less than they’re worth, you will be under-insured. This will likely mean that you won’t have access to sufficient funds to replace or repair items that have been damaged or destroyed in an incident.How can you determine how much home contents insurance you need?Your home insurance should be covered for the correct amount to ensure that you’re able to replace them with equivalent items if they’re lost or damaged due to theft, natural disasters or other acts of nature. The amount for which they should be insured is known as the replacement value. It’s important to make sure your belongings are covered to this level. If they aren’t, you can end up overpaying on monthly premiums or be unable to replace lost or damaged items. Rather than walking around your home estimating the value of various items and keeping a rough tally, create an up-to-date, itemised list of your valuables. Once you’ve drawn up an inventory, you can search for the various items online to gauge how much they would cost to replace. For those pieces that can’t be found online, it’s best to consult an appraiser to get an accurate idea of the item’s value.Can I add new household items to my home insurance policy? This is possible, but you will need to increase the amount of cover you have when you buy new items that affect the value of your household insurance. As much as an automatic increase would be extremely convenient, our purchasing habits vary so much that automatic inclusions are nearly impossible to alter contents insurance quotes automatically. Adding to this, what you buy will also determine the type of insurance that needs to be taken out. While items like chairs, tables, fridges and washing machines can all be included under general home contents, some items, like laptops, certain TVs, jewellery and original artworks, must be itemised. As these are high-value items that are more often targeted by theft, they carry higher risk and insurers therefore usually require special notice before covering them.What isn’t covered under home insurance?Although home insurance quotes include cover for all of the treasured belongings you keep inside your house, it, unfortunately, doesn’t extend to the house itself.The brick-and-mortar structure as well as all of the permanent fittings and fixtures that are attached to the land are covered by buildings insurance. Much like our home insurance, First for Women’s Buildings Insurance is specifically designed for women to ensure that you can rebuild your sanctuary in the event that it’s damaged or destroyed.Whether it’s theft, fire, flood, or another natural disaster or act of nature, buildings insurance will ensure you can restore your home, granny flat, boundary wall, swimming pool or garage to their former glory.Yes, you can. In fact, we recommend that you cover your home contents and building under a single policy. This is so that if you have a home emergency or need to claim, you only need to remember our contact numbers. You don’t need to try to remember which insurer takes care of your building and which takes care of the contents, because it’s all with one home insurance company.Additionally, because we offer insurance specifically designed for women, you know you’re getting all the cover you need to help you look after your home.How much is home insurance monthly?Because we specifically design our insurance for you, we give you a tailor-made premium to cover your household goods. So, we will need to give you a household insurance quote first. How much you’ll pay depends on your individual circumstances, like how much your home contents are worth, the area you live in, what the replacement value is of your possession, and other variables.

        "content": "Being involved in a car accident can be stressful and confusing. What do you do when your car is immobile after being involved in an accident? That’s where insurance for vehicles from 1st for Women comes to your rescue. Whether you ride a scooter or motorbike, drive an off-roader or a boat, vehicle insurance can give you peace of mind. In this guide, you’ll learn about the different types of insurance for vehicles, why you need each and how it protects your valued investment.Understanding the different types of vehicle insuranceCar insurance at 1st for Women comes in four flavours: comprehensive; third-party, fire and theft; BetterCar and third-party only insurance plans.Comprehensive car insurance: Covers your vehicle for numerous events and incidents, such as theft, damages and collisions. Because it provides the highest level of cover, comprehensive car insurance minimises your out-of-pocket expenses.Third-party, fire and theft insurance: This insurance covers you in case you damage someone’s car or property if the vehicle gets stolen or a fire damages or completely destroys your car.Third-party only car insurance: It covers you only if you damage someone’s vehicle in an accident. 1st for Women takes care of the expenses incurred due to any fault you may have accidentally caused.BetterCar insurance: If your vehicle gets written off during an accident, 1st for Women will replace it with a one year newer model of the same make. If the newer model isn’t available, we will pay out 15% more than the value of your written-off vehicle.Did you know you can get insurance for vehicles other than cars?Do you own a boat, motorcycle, caravan or trailer? If so, you should get specialist insurance cover for that vehicle. If you have a 4x4 and enjoy a bit of off-roading, you face special situations that your normal car insurance may not cover.The risks you face while driving a boat or motorcycle differ from those you face while driving a car. Because of different risk profiles, it’s important to have the appropriate vehicle insurance cover. This guide covers four types of insurance for vehicles that you may need to have.  1. Motorcycle insuranceDo you get around town or take long rides with a motorcycle or a scooter? If so, you should get motorcycle or scooter insurance. The Motorcycle Safety Institute of South Africa’s 2018 research revealed that 77% of all reported motorbike accidents and crashes were caused by the rider.*The same pattern appeared in 2019. Can you afford to be without motorbike insurance?It can be costly to replace or repair your motorbike or gear after accident damages. Imagine damaging your helmet worth R12,700 during an accident! Not many have that kind of money stashed away in their bank account.Motorcycle insurance works the same way as car insurance: It covers you in the event of an accident on the road, theft and loss. Motorcycle insurers, like 1st for Women, consider your gender and age, type of motorcycle, where you live and your driving record. Our motorcycle insurance covers you for theft, third-party liability, damage or loss.2. Trailer and caravan insuranceHit the road with your home-on-wheels to your holiday destination without worrying about what might happen if you’re involved in an accident.According to the country’s National Traffic Information System (eNaTIS), the number of caravans registered stood at 98,096 in June 2021.* This means thousands of South Africans take long-distance trips to exciting places, such as the Kruger National Park, Drakensberg or Richtersveld for holidays or camping.Caravans provide an affordable holiday home. While hauling it to your holiday destination or camping site, you may encounter road accidents, theft or hail damage. The same can happen while towing your trailer to deliver valuable goods. At times like these, you need to have trailer or caravan insurance.A caravan or trailer insurance policy will not only cover you in the event of an accident, but it will also cover theft. If you choose to protect the loss of your valuable items inside a caravan or trailer, this insurance can cover that, too. 1st for Women will consider the value of your caravan or trailer, where you keep it and proof of ownership when quoting you on a caravan or trailer insurance.3. Off-road 4x4 insuranceOff-roading and 4x4 driving adventures are popular pastime activities for many South Africans. Imagine crossing a river with your landrover and suddenly, more water than you thought forcefully drags your car down the river, and it overturns?After rescuing the vehicle, you discover extensive damage to the body, upholstery and engine. You call your insurer and explain the situation, but they tell you that your car insurance doesn’t cover off-roading mishaps.The scenario above may sound like a movie scene, but it has happened before and it can happen again. Your ordinary car insurance often covers you and your car for normal road use, theft, loss or damage due to fire or hail. For events like this, you need specialist insurance, like 4x4 insurance.If you have a collision with another vehicle while off-roading, your car insurance might cover the damages and third-party liability; The insurer may take the accident as if it happened in normal car use.What if your 4x4 overturns on a sand dune or steep hill while enjoying your off-roading adventure? It’s unlikely your car insurer will cover any damages you incur. That’s why you need a specialist 4x4 off-roading insurance.Keep safe with 1st for Women’s comprehensive off-road car insurance.4. Boat insuranceNothing beats the memories you make in a boat gliding on the ocean, dam or river water: The cool breeze soothes your skin and the scenery is breathtaking. But a disaster can strike within the blink of an eye. Will you be prepared to deal with the consequences?Whether you enjoy jet skiing, fishing or water boating for domestic, pleasure or social purposes, boat insurance can come in handy. Boat insurance works like car insurance: You claim if certain events happen, like a boat accident or damage to your boat.Boats can be expensive to repair, depending on their condition, type and brand. Imagine owning a boat valued at R600,000! Could you afford to drive it in an unpredictable ocean without protection? No fisherman should risk losing their investment because they didn’t insure their boat.Boat insurance covers you for third-party injuries, loss of life, damage to your boat, loss and theft. If your boat’s hull, engine or engine sails get damaged, boat insurance will ensure you’re covered. In addition to the boat itself, First for Women also covers gear and equipment.Boat insurance follows the same process as obtaining car insurance. Some of the requirements for getting boat insurance include a well-maintained fire extinguisher. The value of your boat will be a key factor in determining your premium.Get insurance for vehicles with First for WomenWhether you own a boat, trailer, caravan or you do 4x4 off-roading, you should consider protecting your investment. Accidents, theft or loss can happen when you least expect, and you don’t want to be caught wanting. Get yourself insurance for vehicles, such as boat insurance or off-road 4x4 insurance by applying for a free online quote.Sources:News24: Bikers remain more vulnerable CaravanSA: Small market, amazing potential - recreational vehicle in SA"

        "description": "",
        "content": "You’ve invested time, money and considerable effort into creating and enhancing your home. Taking steps to protect your investment can reassure you that you’re financially covered should the unthinkable happen. Whether you’re a first-time household insurance buyer or are seeking a home insurance upgrade, knowing the ins and outs of this type of insurance coverage can help you select the best product for your needs. It can also ensure that you aren’t left in the lurch when making a claim. A lot of confusion surrounds home insurance however, and what you can expect from it. To help you understand this type of insurance, First for Women has addressed seven of the most common myths people have about home contents insurance. Here’s what you need to know.Setting the record straight about household insuranceIf you’ve never invested in household insurance before or have used the same insurance product for years, you might assume that you have sufficient coverage. You might also assume that changing or switching will require complex paperwork or spend hours on the phone — discouraging you from making any changes. Setting aside time to regularly update or assess your household insurance cover can save you time and hassle down the road. The last thing you want is for a crisis to occur, only for you to discover that the money you assumed was coming to your aid wasn’t part of your cover in the first place.Myth 1. Household insurance covers damp and mould damageBy the time you’ve noticed rising damp or condensation damage in your home, it’s likely been festering for years. Often stemming from poor quality building materials or construction, Damp or mould usually manifests in moist walls and allergen-producing mould. You might have unknowingly purchased a home with rising damp from an unscrupulous estate agent, or you could also have an older home that’s developed damp over several decades. Damp-related claims are usually rejected by insurers as they consider it a preventable problem. If you suspect you might need to make a claim because of it, you’ll need to determine if your insurer offers specific but separate damp and mould coverage. Myth 2. Household insurance covers all types of weather damage, including floodsIt’s easy to assume what weather damage is fully covered by insurance. After all, it’s unpredictable and you can’t prepare for it. In reality, many insurers only cover certain disasters or limit their coverage to certain areas of your home. For example, they might cover hail damage but not flooding or cover repairs to your home but not your garage. It’s important to remember that building insurance is often treated as a separate product to home contents insurance. If you choose one but not the other you could find yourself covered for damage to your home but not what’s inside it.Myth 3. All the items inside your home are automatically covered by insuranceHome contents insurance is valuable when you’ve been burgled or your home’s assets have been damaged. However, there can be claim limits for general categories, such as the collective value of the spoiled food you lost when your fridge or freezer broke down. If you’re insuring a high-value product like jewellery or a piece of art your insurer can request an updated valuation certificate when you make a claim to attest to its value. You’ll also need to prove that you stored these types of items securely if they’re over a certain value.Myth 4. If you file an insurance claim, your premiums automatically increaseNo. Not all home insurance claims are high. In these cases, you might consider replacing an item or making a repair yourself instead of submitting your claim out of fear it will increase your premiums. While no two insurers will evaluate a claim the same way, most will take into account if your claim was reasonably preventable. For example, someone submitting a claim for a roof leak might face higher premiums if it’s determined the leak was caused by neglected and clogged gutters. Someone experiencing a roof leak after a week-long unseasonal storm might not experience an increase. Find out more about How to Make a Claim, if you’re unsure.Myth 5. Homeowner’s insurance replaces your belongings with new onesYou should insure each individual item in your home for its current value. When insuring your home collectively, you might be tempted to underinsure certain items to reduce your premiums. However, by doing this you might not be able to replace your belongings with something of the same quality and value. When your items are replaced, you get the exact same item or a similar one and not necessarily the most modern one available. For example, your 2015 smartphone won’t be replaced by its 2022 model but rather one with similar functionalities.Myth 6. Household insurance is compulsory for homeownersIt’s completely up to you whether or not you invest in household insurance as well as the type of coverage you choose. The only time comprehensive home insurance might be legally required is when a bank is financing your property — and when this happens they usually require you to insure the structure itself, which is buildings insurance, and not its contents.Myth 7. You have to insure your home at the market valueYour home insurance is meant to return your home to what it was like right before an incident took place. It doesn’t take into account your property’s value — something that often has more to do with your property location and size than the actual structure. If a faulty heater burns down your bedroom, your insurance will cover the cost of restoring the bedroom to what it was before. If you’d like to take the opportunity to add a bathroom extension and install a hot tub to it, you’ll need to finance this yourself — and update your insurance afterwards.Get a household insurance quote from First for WomenHousehold insurance can seem complex, but it’s important to understand that every inclusion and exclusion is created to give you peace of mind.

        "heading": "Why More South African Women Are Getting Portable Possessions Insurance",
        "description": "",
        "content": "If you\"re like many women, you won\"t head out to work or run errands without what feels like half of your home\"s contents in your handbag. At the very least this will include your smartphone, house and work keys and your wallet. These items help your life run smoothly and if you were to lose them, it would be a major inconvenience. However, you might not know that your handbag\"s contents aren\"t covered by your household contents insurance. It\"s why many South African women are choosing First for Women\"s portable possessions insurance. Here\"s what you need to know about this insurance product.What are portable possessions?Before you can understand what portable possessions insurance covers, it helps to know how insurers define portable possessions. In short, portable possessions are those items that spend more time on your person (or in your bag or car) than they do at home. It can cover jewellery you wear every day, such as your diamond wedding ring or the stainless steel quartz watch you received on your birthday. It also includes larger items you travel such as your personal laptops or any specialised equipment. Portable possessions insurance is helpful as it keeps you from having to insure each of these items separately.How does portable possessions insurance differ from home contents insurance?Portable possessions insurance gives you peace of mind for just about any item you keep with you more often than you keep at home. It also streamlines your coverage as, without it, you might have to pay for individual cellphone insurance, jewellery insurance or watches insurance. You can customise your coverage to specifically include high-value items and if this doesn\"t suit your needs, you can opt for a generalised coverage up to a certain amount. To illustrate how portable possessions insurance can suit everyone, here are two examples of what portable insurance cover can look like. In example one, Dineo runs a family photography business. She travels frequently to clients’ homes or locations to take photos. She takes her Canon EOS R5 camera and Macbook Air with her so that she can show clients photos after they’re taken. Unfortunately, someone breaks into her car while she stops at the mall on the way to a client. Dineo is upset but reassured. She has comprehensive car insurance, which will cover the cost of her car\"s window repair. She’s also insured her camera and laptop in her portable possessions insurance, so she knows that she\"ll be able to replace them and get back to work in no time. In example two, Clara is a young professional who\"s just moved out of her family home into a rented flat. She\"s chosen a generalised portable possessions insurance product in her budget, on her mother\"s recommendation. One day at work there\"s a fire in the office and while she\"s safely evacuated, her handbag is destroyed. While shaken, Clara is relieved as she has portable possessions insurance. Even though her handbag only contained her flat keys and her cellphone, her insurance will help her replace these items without having to tap into her savings.What does portable possessions insurance cover?Here are some of the items you can have individually covered by your portable possessions insurance:1. Cellphone insurancePortable possessions insurance will cover your phone in the case of theft, accidental damage or destruction. Even if your phone is under warranty, this will come in handy as your warranty will only replace or repair your phone if it’s experienced electrical and mechanical failure or some forms of wear and tear. Lynette Van Locherenberg [1], head of First for Women Insurance confirms that “According to the 2016/2017 Victims of Crime Survey which was published by Stats SA in September 2017, cellphones dominate the list of items lost through theft of personal property, affecting 76% of the respondents”.2. Jewellery insuranceInsuring expensive jewellery (including watches and rings) separately to your home insurance is a good idea if you wear these items often. Many home insurance products specify that you need to keep valuable jewellery at home in a protected safe when not in use. Having portable possessions insurance will cover these items if you\"re travelling with them or wearing them. As with all valuable items, make sure they’re insured for their appraised value as outlined by an authorised jeweller.3. Bag insuranceIf you\"ve invested in a designer handbag, you\"ll want to insure the bag itself as well as its contents. If you have other insured items that you carry around in bags such as laptops or equipment, you might want to insure these bags too. After all, you don\"t want to end up with a brand new laptop but nothing to store it in when you\"re driving!4. Glasses insuranceEyeglasses are one of these things you forget about insuring but you\"d struggle to cope without. You can ensure these and your sunglasses too, but make sure you specify if they’re prescription lenses as well as their value.5. Clothing insuranceRegularly travel with couture or designer clothing for business or pleasure? You can ensure these items to their value too.6. Insurance for computersMany people have both a PC and laptop, with the former plugged in at your home and not moving and the former able to travel with you to work, coffee shops or clients. Portable possessions insurance covers can cover this device, but if you’re using one provided by your employer they will need to insure it themselves under the business\"s insurance. Just like your cellphone, your insurance generally won’t cover what your laptop warranty will cover and vice versa. It’s also important to note that it will be insured for its value and that you might not get the latest make and model of your choice should your insurer replace it.Get a portable possessions insurance quote from First for WomenWhether you’re considering All Risk comprehensive portable possessions insurance, standard Portable Possessions Insurance covering your bag and its contents for up to R25 000 or want to insure one or two items under portable possessions insurance, First for Women can customise an insurance product for you that meets your needs and suits your budget.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Personal devices like laptops perform a double duty for many of us, keeping us connected to the office and entertained after hours. The lines between work and play have never been more blurred. Losing your laptop or having it stolen can cost you more than just the price of replacing the device itself. This is why laptop insurance or portable possessions insurance from First for Women is so important. Here’s what you need to know about laptop insurance prices and how to choose the best coverage for your needs. It won’t happen to me, right? According to the South African Police Service, crime might have slowed during the Covid-19 lockdown, but it didn\"t come to a stop altogether[1]. A significant volume of crimes also occurred outside of the home and outside of businesses or office buildings. Robberies at non-residential premises increased by almost 60%, while theft out of a motor vehicle increased by over 20%. Contact-related crimes (any crime involving an indirect contact between at least two people) also increased by over 40%.When you\"re not at home, your belongings might not be as safe as you think they are. Whether you\"re driving between meetings or waiting at a coffee shop to speak to a client, your laptop is in transit. Standard insurance options such as home insurance might not apply if it gets stolen or damaged as your computer wasn\"t on your property when it happened. Laptop insurance or portable possessions insurance protects you in these situations. How does laptop insurance work? If you\"re wondering, \"what does laptop insurance cover?\", you will first need to understand the difference between portable possessions insurance and phone or laptop insurance.  In South Africa, laptop insurance often forms part of a larger portable possessions insurance product that covers specific items you can reasonably expect to carry with you when you\"re out of the house. For example, you can expect to have your phone, glasses and laptop with you and maybe toss those items into a designer bag that your partner bought you for your birthday. You might include an item of jewelery you intend to wear once you arrive at your destination as it\"s too valuable to keep on your person. Then there could be a change of shoes for when your feet start hurting and an expensive lipstick you always apply before a meeting for a much-needed confidence boost.  It\"s essential to know what your laptop or portable possessions insurance covers. You can expect comprehensive insurance to cover losses or damages to personal belongings that you or your family carry on their person, as long as those high-value items have updated valuation certificates. You\"ll also need to specify every item you want to be insured. If an item is stolen due to negligence, it won’t be covered, and any item used exclusively for work must be separately insured. You’ll also need to insure each item for its replacement value as picking a figure higher or lower than this can result in the item not being covered at all or you having to replace it with a more affordable, less well-equipped model. Types of portable possessions insurance Not all women keep their entire lives in their handbags - which means that you might find coverage for expensive clothes or jewelry unnecessary. To keep it from adding to your costs, you can typically select the depth of coverage you need, such as phone and laptop insurance, with no further additions. All risk insurance will usually insure your bag and its contents up to a certain amount, with higher value items insured for different, specific amounts. You can also choose to mix and match the following types of standalone coverage: Glasses insuranceLaptop insuranceJewelry insuranceCellphone insuranceCamera insurance Clothing insurance For example, Boipelo is a lawyer who loves taking semi-professional photos for fun. Boipelo is invited to her cousin\"s birthday party at a restaurant in a local shopping mall. She keeps her camera and laptop locked in her boot for safekeeping. Unfortunately, she returns to fetch them sometime later only to find someone has broken into her car and stolen both. Because Boipelo had just taken out portable possessions insurance a few weeks back, she knows her insurer will replace the full value of the items.  If Boipelo had opted for insurance specifically for her camera instead of comprehensive portable possessions insurance, she would only have had her camera replaced. It’s also important to mention that her possessions wouldn\"t have been covered if Boipelo had accidentally left her car unlocked. Also, if she ran a professional photography business, her camera would fall under business insurance and require a different type of policy altogether.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Covid-19 turned working from home from a rarity into a trend. It has now become an entrenched part of working life and many employees and businesses are operating out of a home office. But just because your home is also your workplace, it doesn’t mean you don’t need business insurance. Just like any office space, anything can happen. Unexpected calamities can cripple a small business. Let First For Women provide you with the cover your home office needs, letting you enjoy all the benefits that come with being a businesswoman commanding her own space.The global shift to remote working &amp; the rise of the small businessWorking from home is not a new concept. But in the last few years, it has become more and more popular. There are a few reasons behind this.1) More people are working from homeThere has been speculation throughout the 21st century that there would be a shift towards remote work. But once the Covid-19 pandemic hit,  working from home really became the norm. While many employees have and will continue to return to the office in the coming months, there has been a permanent switch to people working from home as a common part of workplace life.According to research done by the McKinsey Global Institute[1], many executives have indicated that a hybrid model where some employees will work remotely is here to stay. 2) More people are embarking on entrepreneurship - from homeIt isn’t just employees who are moving away from working in high-rise buildings. Many entrepreneurs have realised the benefits of operating their small businesses from home. According to Stats SA[2], the small business sector is growing by 12,3% a year. Many of these businesses have found that the easiest way to cut down on transport and office rental costs is to simply work from home. These home office businesses, like any business, need to seriously consider taking out the right kind of insurance for businesses. H2: Do you need business insurance if you have a home office?Many entrepreneurs who run a business from home may not realise that home insurance does not cover their small business insurance needs. Homeowners insurance is not designed for businesses and will leave out some important coverage.Typical homeowner’s insurance, for instance, will only provide coverage for a small amount of office equipment. If there is any kind of damage or loss to your office, it might not be fully protected by your policy.Can you imagine if your computer breaks down, right before a big delivery, and you can’t access your order forms? It could mean a huge loss, which a small business would struggle to climb back from. The only way to ensure that all your computers and specialised work equipment are covered from a loss like this is to take out business insurance.H2: What business insurance does an SME need?Insurance for businesses isn’t just for big conglomerates. Anyone who runs a home-based business will benefit from having a policy based on their small business needs.One of these is liability cover which financially protects you if there is a lawsuit against you from a client or employee who has suffered a loss or damage while on your property.  Something else to think about is insurance for your products. If the product must be delivered, there’s a chance it could be lost or damaged on the way. Goods in transit cover will limit some of your loss if this ever does happen.It’s hard to imagine, but there have been times when a client has been injured because of goods they have bought. The last thing you want is to face a lawsuit because someone has been injured when using your product. Product liability covers any compensation claims which may come your way.How does working from home affect your current business insurance?It is crucial to speak to your insurer to discuss which business insurance plan will best suit your needs. Because small business insurance is designed to protect unique, individual companies, the type of business insurance policy you decide on will depend on the nature of the enterprise you run.You may think that your home and business life are blurred, but your insurer sees this very differently. For example, businesses which depend on having a virtual office will likely have expensive computers and other technical gadgets like headsets, webcams and tablets which can quickly add up in value. If you have not told your insurer that you are running this business, they may not pay out a claim.When moving to a home office, you may even have added new hardware, such as generators and inverters to help when there are blackouts. This equipment is not easy or cheap to replace. Keeping your insurer updated is the wisest option. They may even suggest that comprehensive business cover might be best in this scenario, so that you are adequately covered if anything happens.Which kind of business insurance is best for small business owners?There are many different types of business insurance and only some of the options are better suited for small companies and entrepreneurs. As many entrepreneurs rely on the income from their home office to support both themselves and their families, getting the right insurance cover is crucial.Unfortunately, mistakes and accidents happen no matter how prepared we think we are, especially when dealing with the public. The last thing you want is to not be covered when the unthinkable happens.Imagine if you give the wrong professional advice to a client? The results could be terrible. With errors and omissions insurance, you would be given legal advice in case a legal suit is brought against you.What about if clients come to your home office or delivery workers step onto your property and one of them slips and breaks a leg? This opens you up to liability claims. Liability insurance will protect your financial interest if there is ever a lawsuit or third-party claim taken out against you for any injury or loss on your business premises.

        "content": "If you compare your home now to what it looked like when you first purchased it, it’s probably changed significantly. Renovations or upgrades are what help us transform an impersonal structure into a home we feel comfortable in. As your family grows and changes, you may want to make more changes to your property — and you should update your property insurance accordingly. As a South African property insurance company trusted by millions, First for Women wants you to get the most out of your property insurance cover. It\"s why we recommend that you revisit your property insurance or building insurance annually.What is property insurance?Property insurance (also known as building insurance) insures your property against possible damage. It considers your property to include the physical internal and external structure of your home. It also includes any permanent fixtures on the property such as fences, driveways and swimming pools. Property insurance finances the restoration of your property should it get damaged and will cover returning it to the state it was in before the damage occurred. However, it’s important to note that your home contents are not covered by property insurance. To put it simply, anything you could take with you should you move home counts as part of your home contents insurance and not your property. You’ll need to take out a separate home contents insurance to protect these belongings.Why you need to review your building insurance policy each yearYour home might be built to last decades, but that doesn\"t mean it’s intended to stay in its original state for eternity. A quick internet search of ‘70s-style homes with their carpeted bathrooms and sunken seating areas can attest to this. In addition to changing your home to keep up with the times, you\"ll also need to adjust it to meet your family\"s needs. After all, a single bathroom shared amongst a family of six isn\"t going to cut it and your twin boys will want separate bedrooms when they get older. Then there\"s maintaining your home to keep it safe and habitable. Your home could develop cracked walls and rising damp years after you purchased it. And if you\"ve been living in your home for over a decade, certain elements will have come to the end of their natural lifespan and need replacing. This can include things such as exterior painting, smoke detectors and certain vents.It\"s always a good idea to repair or renovate your home when the need arises. Not only will it prevent more costly work down the road, but it will also add to both the real and the market value of your home should you sell it at a later stage.Making it an ingrained habit to check in with your insurers whenever you change your home will keep your property insurance cover in line with your property. Even if you aren\"t sure if your changes count as an adjustment to your home, your insurer should be able to inform you and let you know if you need to take action.3 times you should review your property insuranceIf you’re still unsure about what can necessitate a change to your home insurance, the following situations could indicate you need a revised property insurance quote: When you’ve made permanent property improvements or renovations Your property insurance cover will pay for loss or damage to the permanent structures on your property, however, it won\"t cover any home improvements or renovations you’ve made without receiving approval from local councils. It also won’t cover you for faulty design or construction or work not in compliance with national building regulations that results in loss or damage.  When you’ve added freestanding structures to your property Your building insurance covers any structures you erect on or integrate into your property. However, if you build something on your property for rental purposes, you\"ll need to alert your insurer. If you don\"t do this, any damage a tenant makes to it can be excluded. You\"ll also need to alert your insurer if part of your property will be unoccupied for an extended period. For example, you might build a cottage on your property for a grandparent to move into when they retire in a few months’ or a year\"s time. Making sure it\"s covered will ensure you can pay for any necessary repairs to the unoccupied structure. When you’ve insured your home for market value Location is everything and it impacts your property value[1]. However, no matter how high this figure might be, you shouldn’t consider it when insuring your property. Building insurance will only pay to restore your property to the state it was in before the incident — no more and no less. It\"s critical you\"re aware of the replacement value of your property and its various elements. Selecting a figure below or above  this can result in you not having enough money to pay for repairs or alternatively paying higher premiums without experiencing any corresponding benefits.Different types of building insurance coverIn South Africa, property insurance cover can range from basic coverage to something more comprehensive. It will be well worth your while to sit down and make a detailed list of every element you\"d like insured, before making your selection of any property insurance quote. This will ensure you enter into your property insurance with your eyes wide open and with no unpleasant surprises on the horizon.Get a property insurance quote from First for WomenYou\"re going to be parting with your money every month to pay for your building insurance, therefore you should be able to ask as many questions as you need to feel satisfied with your decision.

        "description": "",
        "content": "We recognise that every woman is different. That’s why First for Women offers several different levels of car insurance plans depending on your needs. We’re also aware that getting insurance can be a bit tricky and confusing, so we decided to take a look at your most common car insurance questions so we can help you out. This way, you can make an informed decision and feel confident when taking out an insurance policy. Car insurance questions and answers: what you need to know1. How does car insurance work?Car insurance is a financial policy that you take out with an insurer to protect your vehicle against various kinds of damage or theft. The policyholder will pay a monthly premium to their insurer, like First for Women Insurance, in exchange for car cover. This policy will protect the vehicle against events like a car accident or hail damage. The type of car cover you receive will depend on your particular insurance policy. Should you experience an event for which you need to claim you will contact your insurer to file an auto claim. Your insurer will, in turn, evaluate your claim and the damage to your vehicle, and pay out the relevant party. This could be to a third-party, the policyholder or the respective service provider, like a panel beater. 2. Is it compulsory to have car insurance?No, car insurance in South Africa is not compulsory. In fact, the South African Insurance Association estimates that up to 70% of vehicles on our roads are not insured. First for Women strongly advise getting adequate car cover, however, because the cost of covering the repair or replacement of your vehicle could have huge financial implications. 3. Which insurer offers the cheapest car insurance?Cheap car insurance is offered by several different insurers. However, cheap is not always the best, as the Automobile Association highlights in their article  about the dangers of getting cheap car insurance. Car insurance premiums are calculated based on risks. The higher the risk, the higher the premium. If you think that your car insurance premiums are a little bit steep, here are a couple of reasons why this might be the case:Age: With regards to age, your insurance premiums are usually the best they can be from the age of 25 to 70 years old. Young drivers pay very high premiums because they are considered high risk, while older drivers are considered ‘experienced’ and therefore pose a lesser risk.Your car type: The make and model of your car also determines your insurance premiums. Sports cars and luxury vehicles usually incur higher premiums because special features are expensive to replace.Where you park: Do you park your car in a locked garage? Great! Your insurance premiums will be lower than someone who does not keep their car in a garage and even lower than someone who parks on the street overnight. This is because your car is seen as being at a lower risk of being stolen or broken into when you keep it in a safe spot overnight. Consider how safe your car is when you’re at work too. Parking bays in secure, preferably covered or underground spaces mean lower risk and lower premiums. When you drive: Consider your daily driving routes and the time of day you are on these routes, because this will also determine whether you are a high- or low-risk client and have implications on your monthly insurance premiums. Driving longer distances in peak traffic or unsafe areas at night usually incurs higher premiums than driving short distances during the day on fairly safe routes. Discover more about the pitfalls of cheap car insurance from First for Women and find out how you can lower your insurance premiums.  4. Which type of car cover is best for your car?The first thing you need to do once you’ve decided to insure a car is to find out what packages your insurance company offers and which of those suits your financial needs best. First for Women offers Comprehensive, Third-party, Fire &amp; Theft, and Third-party Only Car Insurance. We also offer BetterCar Insurance, which is an auto add-on product.

        "content": "Take a minute and think about the role your mother, grandmother, sister or aunt has played in your life! Can you imagine how your life would have turned out without them?Now, what role are you playing in your family? Perhaps you&rsquo;re a stay-at-home mom, a freelancer or have a career with one of South Africa&rsquo;s top companies. One thing is true &ndash; you play a significant role in the family. Death is tragic and can unfortunately occur unexpectedly. This is a good reason to have life cover. Think about the following questions for a moment.If you die, will your family and loved ones survive financially without you? Will your children still be able to afford to attend the universities of their choice?If the answer to either of those questions is a &ldquo;No&rdquo;, you have every reason to consider taking out life insurance from First for Women. In this article, you&rsquo;ll learn about three life insurance products that can help protect your family and loved ones financially in case things change, you become disabled or sadly suffer from illness.Life cover: a necessity for the modern woman Whatever your role is, you&rsquo;ll be aware of the unpredictable nature of life and by seeking a life policy you&rsquo;re wise. If you want to protect your dependents financially even after your passing, read on.Taking out a life insurance policy is a simple strategy to ensure your family\"s lifestyle can continue from a financial perspective. Life cover is an agreement between you and an insurance company or bank whereby you pay a monthly premium. If anything were to happen or you which is covered in your life cover insurance, then the provider will pay out a lump sum to your beneficiaries. Your dependents can use this money to cover financial obligations they otherwise could not afford. A portion of this lump sum could be used to prepare a respectable funeral for you. The remaining money may be used to cover expenses, such as paying off your bond or vehicle loan or ensuring your children&rsquo;s education.The size of the life cover varies based on your needs. For example, if you contribute R5,000 a month to your family, and you want them to receive the same for five years after your death, you&rsquo;ll need a minimum cover of R200,000. Adding R50,000 for funeral expenses means you&rsquo;ll need to increase your life cover to R250,000.Do you know about these three life insurance products? Death is not the only tragic thing that can happen to a woman; there are other bad events that unfortunately can also happen. The sad thing is that when such events occur, the financial future of your dependents may be at risk. Three life insurance products can protect them financially in case you are not able to provide for them anymore. Read on to learn what those life insurance products are and what they cover. Dread disease coverIn South Africa, heart attacks, cancer, coronary bypass surgery and strokes make up between 70% and 90% of dread disease claims. Dread disease cover is insurance that covers the costs associated with treating these unfortunate illnesses. The critical illnesses covered will depend on your policy and may include dread diseases such as kidney failure, respiratory failure, cancer, chronic liver failure and full-blown AIDS. Cancers and tumours make up about 30% of dread disease claims. [1]According to the U.S. National Kidney Foundation, women are more likely to suffer from kidney disease than men. What&rsquo;s concerning is that two in five adults could be suffering from kidney disease and not even know about it! [2]A 2020 research study published in Circulation, the journal of the American Heart Association, found that women are 20% more likely to develop heart failure or die within five years due to chronic heart attack when compared to men. [3]The above factors make it necessary for women to consider taking out dread disease cover. If the policyholder is diagnosed with a critical illness, they receive a one-off, tax-free lump sum from their insurer. In some cases, the insurer may pay out a percentage of the critical illness cover, depending on the severity of the illness. For example, if you are found to have stage 1 cancer, your insurer may only payout 25% of your claim, compared to a larger percentage if you&rsquo;re unfortunately in the later stages of the tragic illness. Disablement coverDisablement cover is also called disability insurance. It&rsquo;s a cover that provides an income if you can&rsquo;t work anymore due to an injury or illness. It will provide you with a tax-free income that&rsquo;s needed to cover expenses such as altering your home or vehicle to cope with your condition.Disability cover comes in two types: the lump-sum benefit or the monthly benefit cover. In the lump-sum benefit option, your insurer pays out in full if you become permanently disabled. The monthly disability cover, however, pays out income each month, making it ideal for self-employed women. This type of disablement cover also covers temporary disabilities.Your premium depends on your age, health status, whether you smoke or not, gender and premium pattern.Your disablement cover does not cover all disabilities. For example, it won&rsquo;t cover you if you are disabled due to taking part in a war, terrorism or civil commotion. Other events that can result in disablement that are not covered include the following:Taking part in a dangerous sportIgnoring or not following reasonable medical adviceAbusing drugs or alcohol Pure life coverAs a woman, you have numerous responsibilities, and no doubt, many people depend on you. It can be hard to think about how those people would survive if you are sadly no longer around.An insurance policy that helps protect your family and loved ones financially in case you die is called pure life cover or pure life insurance policy. It gives you and your family peace of mind, knowing that they will be taken care of financially upon an untimely passing. Most pure life insurances cover for accidental death immediately. Death from more complex reasons such as suicide and natural causes can be subject to waiting periods.When you enter into a pure life cover agreement with an insurer, you agree to pay a premium in exchange for a certain amount of cover. Often you are required to pay this premium monthly. In the event of your death, your insurer pays out a lump sum to your beneficiaries and dependents.The insurer does not dictate how the lump sum payout should be used. For this reason, it can be used in many different ways, e.g. to help in making funeral arrangements or paying debt or covering the education fees of your dependents.Your insurer calculates your life cover premium based on your age, occupation, health, the sum insured and other factors, such as whether you smoke or not. The amount of life cover varies from person to person, but it should take into account affordability, your income and the future income needs of your dependents. Why South African women need life insuranceImagine the amount of work that you do for your family: working full time, cleaning the home, driving friends and family around, financial planning and shopping for nutritious groceries. Whatever you&rsquo;re doing has a cost. Who would do these things in the case of your unfortunate passing, disablement, or suffering from an unexpected critical illness?Women of all ages around the world face the real risk of breast cancer. Any woman can be diagnosed with breast cancer &ndash; and you want to be ready to deal with it and its consequences if it happens to you. You want your family to be taken care of financially while fighting this critical illness. Someone must take over, even if it means hiring a helper, and that costs money. In your absence, your family might not be able to afford such assistance. That&rsquo;s why having life insurance can be a life-saver for you and your family.Get a life insurance quote from First for WomenFirst for Women knows that researching life insurance is not easy. Few women want to talk about the possibility of death. However, death is sure to come at some stage. The best thing you can do is to prepare for it so that your loved ones remain protected financially. Getting life insurance from First for Women begins by obtaining a life insurance quote.

        "content": "Comprehensive auto insurance doesn’t pay out for outstanding debt in the event your car is stolen or written off. What would happen if such a situation were to happen to you? Do you have enough money saved to cover this shortfall?If your answer is “No”, you should seriously consider getting top-up auto insurance as an add-on to your car insurance. First for Women will make sure that you remain debt-free if you lose your vehicle while still owing money to your financier. In this article, you’ll learn what top-up car insurance covers and when it’s the right time to have it. You’ll also find out what tyre cover is and why it might be necessary to have this too. What is Auto top-up car(credit shortfall) insurance for vehicles? The Rolls-Royce of auto insurance is comprehensive car insurance. While comprehensive auto insurance may be the best type of car insurance, it may not pay out all the outstanding money you owe on your car in the case of theft or write-off. That’s why there’s shortfall insurance, so you won’t have to worry about the shortfall. This means that shortfall insurance covers the gap between the comprehensive car insurance payout and the outstanding balance of the finance on your vehicle.if your car is written off or if it\"s stolen and never recovered. The main benefit of top-up insurance[1] is that you’ll remain without car debt, which is a good position to be in.When do you need credit shortfall insurance? Any of the following three situations might suit having this type of insurance:If you’re financing a car and paying a lot of interest over a couple of years or if you’ll be paying a balloon fee at the end of your finance arrangement, you might need top-up auto insurance.If you cannot afford to cover the shortfall yourself – and few people have enough money saved to cover car finance shortfall – you will benefit from top-up auto insurance.When you buy a new car, it can lose up to 30% of its value in the first three months and 40% in the first year. As a result, if your car is stolen or written off, you’re likely to face a shortfall between the insured replacement value and the amount you still owe on the car, especially in the first year after buying it.To illustrate a shortfall, let’s consider this situation: suppose you bought a new car for R220,000 and have paid off R25,000 on your financing loan before your car gets written off in a car accident. Your comprehensive car insurer pays out R160,000, the prevailing market value of your car, however, because you still owe R195,000 on your car, you’ll have to pay the shortfall of R35,000  (after your insurer’s payment)  out of your pocket –  unless you have top-up car insurance.What is tyre insurance?You’ll be lucky to drive on a South African road without encountering any potholes! Even if you’re a careful driver, potholes may damage your car tyres or rims. The hazards your tyres and rims are exposed to on the road are many, and sometimes tyre or rim damage may occur when you go off the road to avoid a collision. How would you deal with tyre or rim damage that prevents you from driving on?Even if you can continue driving, repairing or replacing a tyre or rim can be costly. When you have tyre cover, you can rest assured that your insurer will repair or replace your damaged tyres or rims. The amount covered will depend on the cover limit agreed upon in your policy schedule.In case a tyre or rim must be replaced, the replacement will be of similar value and specification to the one being replaced. The number of tyres or rims that can be replaced will be according to your policy. In many cases, you can replace up to two tyres or rims per year, depending on your policy. Tyre insurance is one type of cover that may seem unnecessary  –  until you really need it. Do you really need auto top-up and tyre insurance?There’s no doubt that as long as you own a car you need auto insurance to protect yourself financially from theft, damage or third-party liability. But when it comes to tyre or top-up car insurance, your personal circumstances will dictate whether you need these or not. One of the major factors to consider when evaluating whether you need auto top-up or tyre insurance is your budget. If you know that you will not have the lump sum to cover the financing shortfall in the event that your car is written off or stolen and not found, you should seriously consider buying top-up auto insurance.Tyres come in different types, brands and sizes and vary in pricing. Some tyres are expensive, especially run-flat types and tyres for SUVs. In such situations, it’s ideal to consider having tyre insurance. Another situation that might call for tyre insurance is if you stay in an area where roads are littered with potholes. In such areas, the chance of tyre and rim damage is high, and tyres and rims can be very expensive to repair or replace.Whether you choose to have auto top-up or tyre insurance will depend on your unique situation. Regardless of which insurance add-ons you take, First for Women recommends getting auto insurance.

        "content": "Homeowner’s insurance is essential, but perhaps — like  many others — your bank account is looking a little emptier than usual this month, and you want to improve this situation. A perfect storm of local and international events has culminated in price hikes[1] for many of life’s essentials. Fuel prices are higher than they were last year (thanks to a weakening rand) and inflation has pushed food prices up. Then, of course, there\"s the constant presence of load-shedding and rising tariff hikes. If you’re trying to lighten the load by finding ways to cut back, First for Women can help you. Here are four ways to lower your monthly homeowner’s insurance premiums without compromising your coverage.What factors can affect your homeowner’s insurance premiums?When it comes to cutting back on your monthly expenses, your insurance is a good place to start. This is because it isn’t a static product and will change depending on many factors — especially if you haven’t reassessed your household insurance in a while.The following factors can affect your insurance premiums:Bundling your different insurance policies with one insurerHome security The condition, age and location of your home Deductibles and credit ratingThe factors mentioned above can increase or decrease your monthly property insurance premiums. While it can be tempting to leave things as they are, you should know that a failure to update your homeowner’s insurance — so that it accurately reflects the current state of your property — can result in future claims being rejected or your insurer rejecting you as a client. Thankfully, knowing how your insurance premiums are calculated can help you to make a reasonably accurate prediction on whether your premiums are going to increase or decrease.How is homeowner’s insurance calculated?Your insurance premiums are calculated using the current state of your property and cover most permanent structures on your property. To give you an idea of what’s usually covered, think about what you’d leave behind if you moved home. Your homeowner’s insurance premiums will cover the costs of replacing part or all of your property to its previous state — no more and no less.It’s important to note that your homeowner’s insurance is intended to protect your home from unseen events and will cover the costs of restoring it to its previous state. It isn’t a tool you can use to improve your property or cover your maintenance costs. It also doesn’t relate to how much your home is worth or what you paid for your property. In addition, you should remember that the contents of your home will need to be insured separately with a householder’s insurance, or buildings insurance. 4 proven ways to lower your home insurance premiumsAs you’ll have realised by now, being dishonest is likely to backfire on you in the future. Make sure that your household insurance is accurate. This doesn’t mean you have to resign yourself to paying sky-high premiums for the rest of your days. Here are some ways you can lower your insurance premiums.1.    Use the same insurer for all your insurance needsThe average person can have many different insurance products. This can include portable possessions insurance, household insurance and property insurance. If you have insurance products with separate insurers you can contact a primary insurer and enquire about switching all your insurance products over to them in exchange for a discount. This has the added benefit of dramatically simplifying the time and effort you spend on managing your insurance, and you can get everything done via a single touchpoint at one time.2.    Upgrade your home security systemAlthough homeowner’s insurance covers break-ins, how easy it is for someone to break into your home can negatively impact your premiums and claim submissions. Upgrading your home security means that it’s less likely that someone can break into your home easily — this can lower your insurance premium. It can also give you added peace of mind that you’ve taken extra steps to keep your family and belongings safe from harm. Upgrading your home security can lower your household insurance premiums as well. 3.    Maintain and update your homeThe components of your home aren’t made to last forever. Adhering to manufacturer recommendations (when it comes to replacing or servicing elements of your home) is important. It’s also important to maintain them as required and not to use them for any purpose other than their intended use. Looking after your home this way can save you money on your premiums because insurers will see that you’re unlikely to make superfluous claims or ones based on personal negligence.4.    Create a home improvement fundEvery claim you make has the potential to increase your monthly premiums. To avoid making small claims and to reserve your insurance for emergencies, you can create a small savings account to cover the costs of minor repairs or replacements you need around the home. When you do this, be sure to update your insurers on the changes you have made.If you’re still unsure about household insurance, take a look at our comprehensive guide about understanding home insurance and what it covers.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Do you have dread disease cover or disability cover? Many South Africans are either underinsured for these situations or have no cover at all. What would happen to your financial situation if you became disabled or if you were diagnosed with a life-altering disease?For many, this means looking after their loved ones and covering expenses related to their own care becomes a battle. First For Women knows that a lot of women play key roles in their families and provide disability and dread disease cover to help them cover expenses in dire situations. But what kind of conditions does this insurance cover? First, let&rsquo;s understand the difference between the two types of cover. What is a dread disease? Dread diseases are life-threatening or debilitating conditions that can have a massive negative impact on your life. They also affect more people than you imagine. For example, did you know that heart disease, one of the most deadly dread diseases, kills 225 South Africans daily[1]?There are several conditions that are classified as dread diseases, including:Major organ failures of the kidney, heart, lung or liverBlindnessBrain damageAlzheimer&rsquo;s diseaseParkinson&rsquo;s diseaseParalysisCancerChronic coronary heart diseaseChronic liver diseaseMultiple sclerosisMajor burnsStrokeParaplegia or quadriplegiaImagine how your life and those of the people you look after would change if you were afflicted with any of these conditions.Although there are multiple dread diseases, there are four that contribute to at least 70% of dread disease claims: cancer, coronary artery bypass grafts, heart attacks and strokes. Three of these conditions are related to the heart and can often go undiagnosed until it&rsquo;s too late. Did you know that the late Miriam Makeba&mdash;Mama Afrika herself&mdash;unexpectedly died of a heart attack soon after performing at a concert in Italy?Cancer can take many forms, some of which are more debilitating than others. According to the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA)[2], the top three cancers diagnosed among women in 2019 were the breast, cervix, and skin (specifically, basal cell carcinoma or BCC). A similar 2018 CANSA report shows the same three types of cancer leading the pack.Millions of people worldwide and in South Africa suffer from dementia, and, as we get older, the risk increases. One of the common types of dementia is Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, an illness that destroys thinking cells and memory. The 2011 South African Census estimated that 2.2 million people in the country were living with some type of dementia. What is considered a disability in South Africa? If you meet 100 different people in South Africa, nearly eight of them will have some form of disability. According to Stats SA, the percentage of women with disability is 8.3%[3] slightly higher than that of men at 6.5%. As we grow older, we&rsquo;re also more likely to report having a disability.What is a disability really? The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC)[4] considers disability as the loss of equal access to opportunities incurred by individuals with temporary or permanent impairments.A person can suffer various types of impairments, including learning, sensory, physical, neurological, psychological or developmental ones. Any of these could limit a person&rsquo;s activity and sideline them from mainstream society.A person may be born with a disability such as deafness, blindness or language and speech disorder, or incur a disability later in life. The disability that occurs later in life can completely alter a person&rsquo;s life. For example, they may have to learn how to use a wheelchair if they&rsquo;ve lost both legs due to a vehicle accident. Think for a second how many flights of stairs you have to navigate on a daily basis. Now imagine trying to go about a normal day without being able to use them. Anyone can become disabled at any time, whether at work or home. Unfortunately, despite the protections provided to disabled workers by South Africa&rsquo;s Employment Equity Act, a disability could still force you to completely stop working depending on the nature of your disability. How does dread disease cover work?If you&rsquo;re diagnosed with a critical illness that your dread disease cover lists, your insurer will provide financial protection. Typically, a dread disease policy is like life insurance in that your insurer pays out a lump sum amount of money if you&rsquo;re you&rsquo;re diagnosed with a listed illness.It&rsquo;s hard to predict a dread disease or critical illness, especially as humans tend to live longer in modern times and have access to better nutrition and medical care. The best you can do is to protect yourself and loved ones financially in case you develop a severe illness or condition This is where First for Women recommends getting life insurance or more specifically, dread disease cover. How you use the money will depend on your personal situation. You may use the money to:Cover medical expenses the medical aid may not coverAdapt your car or home to cater to any new needsSettle outstanding debt, or cover other expenses. When choosing a dread disease cover, check to verify whether it&rsquo;s standalone insurance or combined with life cover. If it is blended with life cover, your dread disease cover claim will impact your life insurance cover.The benefit amount you receive may vary depending on the stage of your illness. For example, if you&rsquo;re diagnosed with early cancer, your insurer might pay you 25% of the insured amount while in the later stages, the payout could be 75%. How does disability cover work?Disability cover protects the most important financial asset you have in today&rsquo;s society: your ability to generate income. A disability demands altering your lifestyle, often making it difficult both emotionally, mentally, and financially. If you&rsquo;re no longer able to work, this insurance can pay you a lump sum amount of money to cover various expenses, including:Regular monthly costsAccessibility modifications to your car or homePay off debtA permanent disability might leave you dependent on certain out-of-pocket medications, which is why you&rsquo;ll need regular income. Fortunately, disability cover benefits will help cover such costs.When you take out this cover, you enter into an agreement with an insurer to payout in case of your disability in exchange for a monthly premium. The exact amount of premium you pay depends on the size of cover you want and your personal circumstances.Your policy will spell out your premium, benefits, and the benefit period. Often, disability cover policies pay 60% to 80% of your latest taxable income before the disability. You can apply for both life and disability cover with First for Women.

        "content": "Whether you’re heading to that important meeting about your next promotion, picking the kids up from school or taking on the open road for your end-of-year holiday, it’s likely that your car gives you more freedom than anything else in your life. But that sense of independence can quickly vanish if your vehicle gets stuck where it’s parked or on the side of the road because of a mechanical or electrical failure.To ensure you don’t have to worry about the hefty bills that can quickly add up when repairing a vehicle, our motor warranty insurance cover is specifically designed for women who want the ultimate peace of mind on the road. From engine failures and braking system issues to your air-conditioner and electric windows, our extended car warranty covers it all to ensure you can navigate the roads with confidence. What is a motor warranty?A motor warranty is a written guarantee from a vehicle manufacturer that your car parts will last for a particular length of time. Should a malfunction occur, due to no fault of your own, the warranty entitles the vehicle owner to have it repaired or replaced at no extra cost. An extended motor warranty provides unlimited cover from the time the manufacturer’s warranty expires. Pre-owned and extended motor warranties ensure your car is covered no matter its age or the mileage it has on the clock. To ensure you’re never left stranded if your car breaks down, the First for Women motor warranty insurance policy also includes cover for towing and the option to add vehicle rental and overnight accommodation. Plus, you can add our Cash Back Plus to your policy and look forward to a nice little payout in four uninterrupted, claim-free years’ time. If you’ve got a new set of wheels that has a valid warranty, maintenance or a car service plan from the vehicle manufacturer, fewer than 120 000 km on the clock and full-service history, you will also be eligible for the extended mechanical breakdown warranty once the original warranty expires. The pre-owned mechanical breakdown warranty will set different limits for your vehicle based on how old it is as well as how much mileage it’s done. Difference between a car service plan &amp; motor warrantyCar service plans, motor warranty and maintenance plans[1] are some of the phrases that get thrown around when discussing how you’ll look after your car once you’ve purchased it. While some of these cover the same things, there is an important distinction between car service plans and a vehicle warranty.Car service plan. Your car’s service plan will usually cover all of the labour and standard parts that are used when your car is serviced.A motor warranty, on the other hand, gives you financial protection in the event that electronic and mechanical parts on your car fail or malfunction. Most manufacturers provide both a vehicle service plan and a warranty for either a limited time or the mileage covered. The warranty can usually be extended by taking out a policy with an insurer, like First for Women.Benefits of a motor warrantyDo you really need a motor warranty? First for Women believe that having an extended car warranty in South Africa can be extremely useful, especially when you’re a woman on the road. Fixing mechanical or electrical breakdowns can quickly add up. With a First for Women motor warranty, all repair work must be authorised in advance and carried out by an authorised dealer.

Not having to worry about the extra expense of towing charges, vehicle rental or overnight accommodation.3. Finding inspiration in the fact that a portion of your monthly insurance premium goes to the First for Women Foundation to uplift women and combat gender-based violence.4. Getting up to R100,000 cover for your vehicle’s engine over the course of its lifetime.What does a motor warranty cover?A warranty makes provision for a range of mechanical and electrical failures, as well as the parts that will be needed to fix them. All of the internal lubricated components of your engine, transmission, differential and steering mechanism are covered. You will also be covered if they have to fix any damage caused to your vehicle’s engine if it overheats – unless the overheating was the result of a failure of the heat radiator, water pipes or flanges. And because your safety is a top priority, your braking system, (including the ABS control unit and sensors), and windscreen wiper motors, are covered as well.

A woman’s cellphone is equally important considering that you’ve probably installed your banking app, email and preferred social media platforms on your mobile? What about your laptop, with all your sensitive work information or that precious heirloom engagement ring? First for Women offers a standard portable possessions insurance policy specifically designed for women who want to keep their most valued possessions safe, like laptop insurance and jewellery insurance. It\"s comprehensive and covers everything up to a particular value that you and the people who live with you can remove from your home on a regular basis.Why do you need portable possessions insurance?A common question is: why do I need portable possessions insurance if I already have home contents insurance? Isn’t it the same thing? Not quite. Portable, or personal possessions, covers those items you regularly leave your home with - like a cellphone, handbag, laptop or jewellery. Home contents insurance, on the other hand, covers items that remain in your home, like electrical appliances and furniture. Although home contents insurance will cover the items in your home from damage or theft, your personal possessions won’t be covered in the event of an incident, such as theft, if they are in your possession of these items outside of your home. For instance, if your home was burgled and thieves stole your laptop that was in your home office, you would be covered under home contents insurance. However, if you locked your laptop in the boot of your car while you dashed into the store and discovered, upon your return, that you’d been robbed while you were out shopping, the laptop would not be covered under your home contents insurance policy. Likewise, many insurers will require that highly valuable items that you regularly take out of the house, like your engagement ring or a top-of-the-line camera, will need a separate portable possessions insurance policy. Discover Why More South African Women are Getting Portable Possessions Insurance if you’d like to discover the benefits of this type of cover. Types of portable possessions insurance options Whether you bike to work with your laptop in your backpack or you strut into the office, cellphone in hand, donning a designer dress, portable possessions insurance will ensure that all of your valuables are protected against loss, theft and damage. There are two types of cover available:1. Specified valuables. This means that you insure your individual valuables against theft, damage or loss up to a value stated in your policy. For instance, you can get individualised jewellery insurance for your engagement ring, cellphone insurance for your new mobile or bag insurance for your handbag and all its contents. You can even get glasses insurance for your sunglasses or prescription spectacles! 2. Non-specified valuables. This means that your policy covers a general assets list up to a particular value.  Why do some items need to be specified? If you add specified personal items to your cover, you can determine how much each item would cost to replace in the event of a claim, or the sum insured. In order to do so accurately, it’s important to retain the receipt or have your valuables professionally appraised by a dealer or valuer. Keep your receipts and valuations in a safe place. It’s important to note that while your portable possessions insurance premiums may increase annually, the sum for which you insured your specified personal items will not so it’s up to you to review the value of your items regularly to ensure they’re covered for the right amount. Take a look at some of the examples of the high-value items you may want to be specified on your policy in order to be covered for a specific amount:Cellphones[1]Valuable jewelleryCamerasLaptopsGlassesCertain types of clothing, like leather jacketsDesigner handbagsPerformance bicycles, like mountain bikes These items need to be specified because they are particularly valuable and will be more expensive to replace than your standard handbag, costume jewellery or budget pair of shoes. What’s more, the nature of these items means that they are often a target for insurance fraudsters. Requiring specification of such valuables – including a description, valuation and any other means of identification – helps insurers prevent false claims, and saves you the hassle of a delayed payout.What doesn’t portable possessions insurance include?While First for Women’s portable possessions insurance covers standard possessions that you and your loved ones who live with you remove from the house, there are some exceptions where you are not included under this type of cover. Some of these instances are:Items that are stolen from the cabin or boot of a car if there are no signs of a forced entry Goods that go missing after a break-in on a watercraft, like a sailboat A bike that gets stolen while you’re not using it (unless you are able to prove that it was secured to an immovable object)Clothes that damaged or deteriorate due to by moths, vermin, cleaning, ironing, repairing or restoring practices Damage to a watch that’s the result of over-winding, leaking batteries or immersion in waterGet a portable possessions insurance quote from First for WomenThe First for Women personal item insurance policy is specifically designed for women who want to keep their most valued possessions safe.

        "content": "There is always a certain amount of risk involved when you run a business and while an entrepreneurial spirit thrives on taking chances, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do everything possible to protect all your hard work. You might be asking yourself if you really need business insurance? The answer is that having the right type of commercial insurance could mean the difference between your business flourishing or going under. Consider the rollercoaster ride we’ve experienced over the past few years – the pandemic, load-shedding, riots, floods, drought, rising fuel prices, unemployment and war in Ukraine – and the impact these have had on businesses in South Africa. With First for Women’s business insurance, you can protect yourself, your employees and your business’s assets, giving you the support you need for your business to prosper during challenging times.What is commercial insurance?Just as in any other aspect of our lives, accidents can happen in our businesses and, if they do, they can cause severe damage and bring problems when you least expect them to. Good commercial insurance provides cover for businesses and corporations, limiting the damage you may suffer if your business or employees meet with misfortune.  There are many different kinds of commercial insurance designed to meet every kind of risk a business may face. The differing needs of varied business types and sizes are catered for. Tailoring your insurance to your unique enterprise can be the key to its success.  Commercial insurance doesn’t just benefit large corporations. Small businesses, even those operating from a home office, can benefit just as much as their larger counterparts from having good insurance cover. This is because commercial insurance protects all types of businesses against the risks that could impact their success, financially or by reputation. It is important to get business cover separate from your personal insurance. This is because business insurance has higher coverage limits, as well as protecting multiple assets and employees at the same time. A commercial policy is usually structured to meet the company’s day-to-day activities so that all risks and threats are covered. The business insurance checklistWhile each business is unique, there are certain types of cover for business insurance that are recommended for all business owners. This includes policies like general liability cover. There are certain industries, however, such as B&amp;Bs or aviation, that may require additional insurance coverage. For the best advice on what your business needs it’s worthwhile speaking to a trained broker at First for Women. Type of insurance for business you will needHere are a few different insurance policies that you may want to consider:1. Worker’s compensation insurance. If your company has any employees, you should consider getting worker’s compensation insurance. This will cover medical treatment, disability and death benefits. 2. Commercial property insurance. If you are asking yourself: “Do I need commercial property insurance?[1]” The answer is yes – if you own or rent premises for business use. This insurance covers equipment, inventory and furniture if there is a fire, storm or theft.3. Liability insurance protects your business from legal claims that are caused by injury or damage to someone else’s property. There is also product liability cover that protects companies from any harm caused to the public by the products they sell.4. Errors and omissions insurance. This covers a business against any negligence claims due to mistakes made or malpractice. For instance, accountants might need errors and omissions insurance in case they make an error in a customer’s books that result in a tax claim.5. Business interruption insurance. In case your business can’t operate, this policy will compensate you for lost income.6. Office insurance. Even if you run your company from your own home, you still need specific commercial insurance to give you protection for office equipment and inventories that home insurance will not cover. 7. Commercial vehicle insurance. If you use vehicles for your business, consider getting car insurance for business, which will cover employees operating insured vehicles.  Commercial items that need to be insuredYour business might contain more assets that need protection than you realise. Some of these items could include:Office equipment, including computers and furnitureBuilding (roofing and structures)External structures on the propertyBusiness records such as accounting documents or client filesSecurity systems Communication equipment Speciality equipment such as heavy machinery or technology How to get commercial insurance in a few easy steps Don’t be intimidated when taking out commercial insurance, it is easier than it might look. It will just take a few simple steps to see which cover is right for your company’s needs.1.      Review your risks and decide what type of insurance you need.Some businesses are riskier than others, so it is important to look at what your business offers in order to assess effectively what insurance you will need.Think about the following: What type of accidents could happen to either clients or employees at your business premises? For instance, heavy machinery could pose a high risk. If there is any type of negligence, could it result in your company being sued for damages? What about the products you sell? Could they potentially injure someone?You also need to consider your employees. If you employ other people, worker’s compensation insurance is a must.Finally, are there any natural or unexpected disasters that could take place such as fires, floods or riots? If so, it is better to insure against these eventualities.2.      Discuss your needs with a trained brokerOnce you have evaluated your risks, it’s time to speak to a trained broker.

Create a business insurance inventoryKeep a detailed inventory of all your business assets to ensure that everything is covered if you need to make a claim. Your commercial assets include the building you work from, as well as everything inside it, including computers, furniture and documents.It is a good idea to walk through your business premises several times and make a detailed list of all the contents. Take pictures of everything and note down important details, such as item descriptions, serial numbers, purchase dates and the estimated value. Try to keep receipts whenever you purchase something. Make copies and store them both as hard copies as well as in the cloud.4.      Purchase the policy, keep it up to date and review it each yearWhen you have decided on the right policy, it is important to keep up to date with payments. It’s also a good idea to review your policy yearly when it is up for renewal to keep up with any changes your business might have undergone.

        "content": "It seems like just yesterday that we were celebrating the end of what was a difficult year for many. We’re now halfway through 2022, which is an ideal time to pause and reflect on how far you’ve come – and what you need to do to reach your year-end goals.For many of us, saving for a holiday, birthday celebration or new car is a priority. It’s never been tougher to do this. Bloomberg[1] reports that inflation has reached a five-year high – meaning that the cost of living is only going to get higher. If you’re feeling the pinch, you aren’t alone!Before you start upending sofa cushions in search of spare change, you should consider that there are simpler ways to end up with extra money in your account at month-end. Here’s how switching to First for Women insurance could help you out.The Main Reasons People Choose To Switch InsurersIncrease in premium Poor customer/support serviceChanges in lifestyleDesire for better benefitsPersonal preferenceWhen it comes to a product like insurance, it’s easy to part (albeit grudgingly) with your money once a month and not think about it again until you need to make a claim. Insurance is a product that you hope you never have to use, so it’s normal that you might try to keep it out of sight and mind.However, now that you’re halfway through the year, it’s worth a little effort to examine your current insurance and insurance provider to see if your needs are still being met. A lot can change in six months – you can switch jobs, start a family or move to another province. What worked for you at the beginning of the year might not work for you anymore.Even if you’re reading this and thinking your current insurance is ‘fine’, are you happy to settle for this? Switching to another insurer, such as First for Women Insurance, could provide you with unexpected benefits that add value to your life instead of just offering you protection. And what’s even better, you could do so by spending a little less!Can I Switch From One Insurance Company To Another?Yes you can. But it’s important to remember that ‘switching’ your insurance is not the same as ‘cancelling’ it! If you cancel your insurance – which some people are tempted to do to cut costs – you leave yourself vulnerable to financial disaster. If you switch your insurance company, you maintain the financial protection of your property or assets, while changing the insurer.There’s a common assumption that switching insurance providers will come with a paperwork headache and financial penalty. While this might be true of long-term insurance products like medical aid and retirement annuities, it doesn’t apply to short-term insurance. This means that you can switch to First for Women insurance at any time.Provided you carefully research your potential insurance options, you can switch insurers today. Be sure to examine the fine print and ask as many questions as you see fit. For example, if you’re thinking of switching to First for Women car insurance, you’ll want to make sure that you’re happy with the premium and the excess they’re offering you and the time frame of when you will become eligible for a no-claims bonus. How To Switch Insurers: The Process In 6 Easy StepsReview your current needs and match the relevant insurer.Our lives are dynamic and things can change all the time. You need to be sure that your insurance policies are in line with your current needs.Speak to a trained broker to discuss your optionsTo save time you can seek out an insurance broker who will source quotes for you, however, you should be aware that they could possibly receive commissions for recommending certain insurance products. Ask your current insurer about cancellation fees and other mattersOnce you’ve decided you’re not happy with your current insurer, you’ll need to investigate if your current insurance is paid in arrears or in advance and on what date your monthly coverage is deducted. For example, you may want to switch to First for Women home insurance immediately, only to find that under your current insurance policy, you’ve already paid for the month ahead.Once you’ve determined when to cancel your coverage, you can contact your insurer and make a formal written request. Be aware that your current insurer might suddenly offer you a discount or value-added benefits if you choose to stay with them. Before accepting any kind of counter-offer, take time to think about whether it will address your reasons for leaving them in the first place.Purchase the new policyIf you decide to proceed with the switch, contact your new insurer as soon as possible and give them the date you’d like your new insurance to commence. To avoid delays and lapses in coverage, make sure you have all their requested paperwork ready and waiting. Set aside enough time to complete any mandatory tasks that you might need to complete, such as getting your vehicle inspected at a designated centre so that your First for Women car insurance can come into effect without unnecessary delays.Cancel the old policyIt is very important that you cancel the old policy only after taking out the new one! You do not want any potential problems from a lapse in coverageInform your financier and any other relevant people of the change Your final task will be to update your records. If your car is financed, you’ll need to update the financier on your change in insurance providers. You’ll also want to capture pertinent details of your insurance and share them with the relevant people. For example, you might be paying for your son’s car insurance. Alerting him about your new insurance details will mean he knows who to contact in the event of an accident.Get a First for Women Insurance QuoteAs you can see, switching insurance (and specifically switching to First for Women insurance) can be a painless and speedy process that could save you money. If you really want to maximise your savings, you should consider switching all your insurance products to First for Women insurance, as you could qualify for a discounted rate.

        "content": "Thinking about adding the pitter-patter of tiny feet to your home? If you’re considering adopting a dog, the first decision you’ll make is what breed to get. It’s a highly individual choice that will depend on the home you live in, whether or not you have kids or other pets and your overall lifestyle. You should know that the kind of dog you choose will also impact your dog insurance options, so it isn’t a decision to be made lightly. Whether you want a dog as a companion or as a trusted guard dog, these fur babies become part and parcel of your family — and as such you will want to give them the same protection that you provide the human members of your family. Thankfully, First for Women has you covered with pet insurance for dogs — and all the information you need to know about selecting the best dog breed for peace of mind and your pocket.South Africans are a nation of pet loversSouth Africans have always prioritised having pets, and even the Covid-19 pandemic couldn\"t hamper the volume of pets being adopted. Statistics from Euromonitor International show pet ownership grew[1] during the pandemic. Not only are people adopting pets but they\"re also spending more money on them than ever. The same report estimates that the pet care market is currently worth R7.1 billion and is expected to grow by at least 2.5%, over the next five years. This spend comprises pet food, toys and accessories and pet insurance for dogs, cats and other popular animals kept as household pets.What you should know about adopting a dog in SAWhile you might think adopting a dog is as easy as picking out one that you like from a shop or animal welfare centre and then purchasing dog insurance, there\"s a lot more to consider than this. For example, if you live in a complex or estate you might not be able to get a dog at all, or will be restricted in terms of what size or breed you can adopt.Then there\"s the Animal Protection Act of 1962, which governs how we treat pets. While animal cruelty is obviously illegal, there are many other ways to contravene the Act or its amendments accidentally. For example, your responsibility will be to ensure your dog gets the medical care they need should they become injured or ill. Failure to do so can result in a hefty fine or imprisonment. Realistically you\"d never let your pet suffer like that, which is one of the reasons many people are looking at investing in pet insurance for dogs or even dog medical aid plans. This way you won’t end up in the situation where you\"re faced with an astronomical veterinary bill for saving your dog from sickness or any other canine catastrophe. What’s more, the dog breed you’ve chosen could be more prone to certain medical conditions or injuries than others.Best dog breeds for South AfricaAlthough no official statistics exist, it’s believed that the following dog breeds are very popular and firm favourites in South Africa. Here are what they are and what you can expect from them:Small Breed Dogs: Jack Russell, Maltese Poodle, Yorkshire TerrierSmall breed dogs are a popular option for those with limited space, as this type of dog can require little exercise. However, they can also be highly territorial and loud, depending on their breed. Things to keep in mind when adopting a small dog is that they tend to live longer than larger breeds. If taken care of, they might not have many health issues. However, long-haired breeds can require frequent grooming for appearance and hygiene purposes. Additionally, flat-faced breeds like pugs or Boston terriers tend to have breathing and sight issues throughout their lifespan.Family Dogs: Labrador or Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, RottweilerThese larger breeds are ideal family dogs and highly intelligent animals. Most thrive well in households with a decent amount of garden space and plenty of mental stimulation. Provided you invest in training, they’re also relatively uncomplicated to look after. Unfortunately, these larger breeds are also more prone to becoming overweight and developing joint problems like hip dysplasia. While you can purchase a dog from a KUSA verified breeder to avoid dealing with this, there’s often a high price tag and a long waiting list for these purebred dogs.African Dogs: Boerboel, Africanis, Rhodesian RidgebackThese highly active dogs are unique to the continent with many coming from a long line of hunting and farm animals. You can expect these breeds to be active, brave and engaged pets. They’ll correspondingly need plenty of activity and training. Depending on the nature of the dog and its specific breed, you’ll need to ensure its space is highly secure and that you keep them on a leash in public. A failure to do so could see your dog damaging someone’s property or even worse, harming another animal or person.At First for Women we strongly encourage you to consider adoption instead of shopping. You can find a wide range of dogs of all ages and breeds at your local animal shelter. If you’re in Gauteng, we recommend contacting our pet adoption partner, Woodrock Animal Shelter, in Pretoria on 076 155 4439 for more information about the pet adoption process.Keep your best friend safe with pet insurance for dogsHaving doubts about the value of pet insurance is understandable. It’s natural to wonder why you should pay money towards something when you’ve adopted a happy and healthy pup and your biggest problem is keeping them from chewing up your designer heels. The reality is that accidents do happen and dogs get older. While they might not develop the above-listed health issues, even minor ailments can run up a bill when you least expect it.Let’s say little Fido (or Fifi) has been listless and isn’t eating or drinking. After a few days of this, you take them to the vet for a checkup. You find out they need to have surgery. While vet consultation costs can vary[2], you’re looking at a hefty bill for treating your dog. If you’re unsure what level of insurance you need, take the time to read through our pet cover guide on how pet insurance works. Get dog insurance from First for WomenNo matter which dog breed you decide to adopt, you’ll want to explore your options regarding pet insurance for dogs as your choice of breeds will impact your pet insurance prices.

        "content": "A mixture of feelings bubbles up inside you if you ever discover your car has been stolen. At first, your mind refuses to believe that your car is gone; you look around, certain that you must have parked it elsewhere. At that moment, you may feel lost – but don’t panic. With First for Women car insurance, we make your car insurance claim as easy as possible given the stressful situation. We will help you through every step of the process.4 Reasons why you need to make a car insurance claimIf you own a car and are often on the road, the chances are fairly high that you might need to make a car insurance claim at some point.There are four key reasons why you would need to make a claim:Your car is stolenYour car is vandalised or damagedYour car is damaged by an element of natureYour car is involved in an accident or collisionYour insurer will be able to help you, depending on the type of car insurance cover you have taken out. First for Women, for instance, has several car insurance options. Comprehensive car insurance is a policy that will cover you in all four scenarios. It is an all-encompassing cover for loss, theft and damage concerning your car. Third-party, fire and theft insurance will allow you to make a car insurance claim if your car has been stolen, if it is damaged in a fire, or if you have been in an accident where a third party has suffered damage. However, you will not be covered for damages to your own car. Third-party only car insurance will only cover you if you are in an accident that was your fault and you need to cover the costs of damages made to another vehicle.Remember that timing is important. When making a car insurance claim, it is important to make your claim as soon as possible. Any claims made later than 30 days after the incident occurred cannot be processed.Car theft in South AfricaHaving insurance for vehicles isn’t a luxury; it is an essential part of car ownership, no matter where you live in the world, but, in South Africa, it is particularly important because of the high number of car thefts. In 2020 / 2021[1], a year when Covid19 lockdowns occurred and crime was generally lower, there were about 83,000 car thefts and 64,000 car hijackings in the country.According to the South African Insurance Crime Bureau (SAICB), R8,5 million worth of vehicles[2] are stolen or hijacked every year, with many being cloned or crossing the border to neighbouring countries. Car-jamming has also become increasingly common, with many drivers unaware that their cars have not been locked when they leave them.Those who live in urban areas are particularly at risk. Most carjackings[3] occur in Gauteng, followed by KwaZulu Natal. Sedans and hatchbacks are the vehicles most targeted by criminals, with bakkies also often selected. The number of SUVs stolen is rising as well. The brands that criminals priortise are VW and Toyota. No matter how serious the statistics look, having car insurance allows you to prepare for every eventuality, helping you to cope with the financial fallout that comes with the loss of a vehicle.Follow these steps if your car has been stolenIf your car has been stolen, you will probably be in a panic. But try to keep calm and go through this list of steps. They will help you process your auto claim as easy as possible.  1. Activate your tracking deviceIf you have a vehicle tracking device fitted in your car, one of the first things you should do is contact the supplier to activate it. You never know; they may be able to recover your car before it goes too far. 2. Report the theft to the policeThe sooner you contact the police to report a stolen car, the better. Sometimes stolen vehicles can be used to commit other crimes, so you should report it stolen as quickly as possible. You will have to go to a police station to report the crime and fill in paperwork to open a case. You will need:your driver’s licencevehicle registration detailsthe make, model and colour of your vehiclethe vehicle identification number (VIN)You should also tell the police if your car has any distinguishable features, like dents or modifications.3.

Also, take note of the name and position of the police officer who is helping you. Ask the officer to make a certified copy of the report, as you will need to give this to your insurer. The officer will give you a case number. This is very important information that you must keep safe as it is needed to make a car insurance claim.4.

At First for Women, we believe in empowering women with knowledge, which helps them make better business decisions. Discover these vehicle insurance insights from our insurance team, and soon, you’ll be able to  differentiate between a vehicle for private use and one for commercial use, and how this affects your insurance policy. Most importantly, you’ll learn why it’s necessary to have the right kind of car insurance.  Personal and commercial vehicles: what does it mean? While having car insurance is a smart woman’s choice, it’s even more important to have the right type of cover. How you intend to use your car will determine whether you should have personal (or private) car insurance or commercial vehicle insurance. Let’s take a closer look at what it means by a private vehicle and a commercial vehicle.A private car is a vehicle you only use for personal and social reasons, which is the majority of most drivers. This includes driving to and from your regular place of employment or home, picking up the kids from school and zooming off to your favourite mall. A commercial or business vehicle is one which is used for business purposes, like making deliveries or visiting a client at their premises. While some commercial vehicles can include taxis, vans, lorries or trucks, it’s important to note that passenger vehicles also qualify as commercial vehicles if they are used for business. Commercial vehicles can be company owned or privately owned. Let\"s paint a scenario: Would your car be covered if you owned your own small business and were using your vehicle to drop off some documents with a client and accidentally caused a motor accident? If you had personal car insurance, you would probably not be covered. However, if you had business car insurance, you would definitely be covered under the comprehensive vehicle insurance plan. If you’re still unsure about what constitutes a commercial vehicle, take a look at the guidelines provided by the Ombudsman for Short-term Insurance[1] which include the following: Driving a vehicle to and from business meetings or eventsOperating the vehicle to perform business transactions Going to employer-organised training sessions, meetings or conferencesSince the use of a vehicle affects your risk profile, it’s crucial that you provide your insurer with accurate information when applying for vehicle insurance.Difference between private and commercial vehicle insuranceThe right type of insurance protects you financially whether you own a company vehicle or a personal car. Your risk profile or company risk profile will largely determine the cost of your insurance premiums.1. Personal vehicle insuranceThis comes in three versions: third-party only; third-party, theft and fire; and comprehensive car insurance. A third-party only cover plan protects you financially if you accidentally damage someone’s car or property while driving. Third-party, fire and theft car insurance offers third-party-only cover benefits and also pays out if your car is stolen or damaged by fire.Comprehensive car insurance is the Rolls-Royce of car insurance as it covers third-party liabilities and self-caused damages. What personal insurance coversLoss or damages caused by uninsured third partiesAccidental damages Loss or damages due to theft or fireDamages due to natural disasters like floodsWhat’s excluded in personal car insurance?Loss or damage you cause while under the influence of alcoholAccidental damages occurring while using your car for business purposesLoss or damage to your car while driven by an unlicensed driver or a non-regular driver 2. Commercial vehicle insuranceCan you imagine the setback of losing your business vehicle, whether a bakkie, delivery van, or forklift, if you’re uninsured?Like all types of insurance, commercial auto insurance doesn’t cover every scene or situation. However, it does protect you from most of the common risks you might face as you do business on the road.  Let’s look at what it covers and doesn’t cover.What commercial vehicle insurance coversLoss or damage due to theft, fire, or vandalismThird-party liability claims arising from damaging someone’s propertyMedical costs incurred by you or a third party during an accident you causeDamage due to natural disasters such as floods and windExclusion in commercial auto insuranceFor a detailed list of exclusions in your commercial vehicle insurance policy, check your policy documents. Typically, the following are not included in your cover:Damage to tools or goods being transported by your covered vehicleLoss or damage when the driver (you or your employee) was under the influence of alcoholLoss or damage that occurs when driven by someone not included in the insurance policyLoss or damage due to riots, or acts of war For more information, take a look at Your top car insurance questions answered by First for Women. Why you need car insurance for business vehiclesNo one wants to be involved in vehicle accidents or collisions but we can’t turn a blind eye to reality. Between October 2017 and June 2021, South Africa experienced a staggering 37,583 fatal crashes involving 48,330 vehicles[2].Every business wants to generate profits. High expenses are the major reason some businesses struggle to generate sufficient profits and fail to stay in business. Not having commercial vehicle insurance could hit your business hard if you were left without a vehicle or had to come up with the funds to repair or place a damaged car.

However, with so many different types of business insurance, it can be confusing to know what to look for when you’re shopping for the best insurance cover for your specific business.This First for Women’s guide will make finding the right insurance for your business easier. Not only will you discover the types of business insurance you may need, but also what to do to maintain adequate insurance cover.Women-owned small businesses in South AfricaSmall businesses play a very important part in our economy.  Women have generally faced an uphill battle as they’ve tried to close the gender gap in the small, micro and medium enterprise (SMME) sector of the economy. According to Mastercard\"s Index of Women Entrepreneurs[1] the number of women-owned businesses in South Africa increased from 21.1% in 2020 to 21.9% in 2021 on its Women Business Owner benchmark.Women have always been pillars of strength in families. And now we’re seeing this beginning to filter into the SMME sector. Consider the following businesswomen’s success stories as evidence of women’s business power:The co-founder and director of iMED Tech, Nneile Nkholise has shown that optimism and confidence can take any woman far. She co-founded iMED Tech in 2015 to enable people who have lost limbs to live normal lives. Commenting about the strength of women’s potential to run companies, she stated, “By launching iMed Tech, I wanted to confirm a theory that women have the power and potential to run companies in the medical technology sector.[2]  Nkholise isn’t alone in closing the entrepreneurship gender gap between men and women. Sarah Collins, CEO and founder of Wonderbag, designed an innovative non-electric heat-retention cooker. Rural communities benefit from this device without increasing their carbon footprint. Collins’s device contributed to her winning the Climate Change Leadership Award in recognition of her work.It’s women like these two entrepreneurs who inspire First for Women to help women-owned SMMEs to succeed. However, challenges do persist, therefore, fearless businesswomen should ensure that their enterprises are protected with the right types of business insurance. 3 small business insurance tips you need to succeedSmall business insurance is critical for budding female entrepreneurs. The world of insurance is huge, making it hard to pick the right type of business insurance for your particular business, but the following three tips will help make your choice of insurance easier.1. Assess your risksBusiness risk is a real thing. Who can forget the impact of COVID-19 on many small businesses in 2020 and 2021? Some of these businesses never recovered. There are many more risks small businesses face. Since you can’t eliminate risk, it’s worth finding ways to manage it. This is where business risk assessment comes in.Business risk assessment is a thorough process to identify potential risks and their impact. Large companies have adopted it to minimise business risk and to purchase the right business insurance. SMMEs aren’t immune to risks so it’s advisable to perform a business risk assessment. This will give you some idea about what sort of insurance you need. A business risk assessment follows four steps: Identifying hazardsIdentifying assets that could be impactedAnalysing their impact Devising the means to minimise the impact of the hazardsAll risks should be documented. Whilst some hazards can be eliminated, others can’t. At the same time, risks that can’t be prevented can still threaten the survival of your business. For example, an accidental fire could completely damage your assets such as vehicles, offices or workshops. For the can’t-be-eliminated risks, you’ll need to find ways to mitigate them. The right type of small business insurance can protect your business financially.2. Get the right kind of insuranceA small business armed with the right kind of insurance benefits in multiple ways, including:Protecting its bottom lineMinimising business interruptionsAvoiding costly and lengthy lawsuitsSaving moneyTo enjoy the above-mentioned benefits and more, one overarching business policy isn’t going to be enough. The reason is that your business and its needs are unique, therefore, it’s essential to get in touch with a trained First for Women consultant or broker to help you identify what you need.There are different types of small business insurance you might need, including the following:Public liability: An insurance policy that protects a business owner from third-party liabilities in case they’re legally responsible for injury to another person or damage to another’s property.Commercial vehicle insurance: A car insurance that covers business vehicles for accidental damages, theft, third-party liability, fire and natural disasters.Errors &amp; omissions: An insurance policy that covers you in case you’re legally held responsible for damages and expenses incurred by someone due to your negligence or inaccuracy. Business interruption insurance: Having this type of business insurance protects your business in case of loss of income due to a disaster such as fire or hail.Directors and officers insurance: A type of policy that protects directors or officers of a company from personal losses in the case of their being sued.3. Review your policy periodically Business circumstances, just like personal ones, rarely stay the same. They change and can change fast. For example, you may expand your business by adding two new staff members.Each change that happens impacts your business risk profile, which means your current small business insurance policy might no longer provide adequate coverage. That’s why you should review your business policy regularly — at least once a year. Take a look at the Complete Commercial Insurance Checklist for Businesses. There are numerous business reasons you should review your policy, including:Your business is making more money than beforeMost business insurers determine premiums based on the amount of exposure they have due to your business activities. When you make more money, it’s likely you’re producing more products or delivering more services. As a result, you’ll need to ensure your insurance is adequate.You’re offering new products or servicesYou could introduce a new product or service. As you adapt to customer demands, including changing economic circumstances, the risk profile of your business changes.Assuming your existing business insurance still covers you adequately after the change might be a mistake. It’s better to review your business insurance and ensure that all assets are covered.You’ve purchased new assetsYour assets make your business hum, enabling it to keep churning out the products and services your customers need. Additional demand requires purchasing new assets such as vehicles, computers or other machines.All these additional assets may change the premiums of your business insurance. It’s essential to review your policy to ensure you’re not under- or over-insured.Get more with Biz Assist from First for WomenSmall businesses have limited staff, resulting in difficulties fulfilling all the necessary business functions.

        "content": "Business interruption is among the top risks that businesses of all sizes face globally. South Africa’s businesses aren’t spared from this and face serious business risks, including cyber-attacks and pandemics. This makes business interruption insurance in South Africa a necessity. This First for Women guide sheds more light on business interruption risk, its impact on businesses, why you need business interruption cover and what it covers.What is a business interruption risk?Business interruption risk means the financial loss an enterprise suffers due to the disruption of its day-to-day operations. Some losses, such as reduced turnover due to machine breakdown, are easy to observe, while others caused by reputational damage are more difficult to see. Whether financial losses are observable or not, the ultimate result for the business is that finances plummet.Many business risks — such as fire, cyber incidents, natural disasters, breakdowns of critical machinery and pandemics, like COVID-19 and its variants — could interrupt the normal operations of a company.To put a business risk into perspective, let’s consider the impact of the floods that occurred in KwaZulu-Natal in April 2022.[1], resulting in total financial losses estimated at R7 billion.The floods damaged infrastructure of various kinds, including water, electricity and rail. This means that businesses that relied on water, electricity and/or rail transportation had no way of running their normal operations.Certain business interruption risks — such as pandemics — affect some industries more than others. For example, when COVID-19 hit the world, South Africa went into a forced lockdown for months, negatively impacting the tourism sector.In 2019, before travel restrictions, South Africa welcomed 21.8 million tourists. By the end of 2020, this number had shrunk to 6.4 million, which is a decline of 70.6% in just one year! Think about this impact on many small businesses such as restaurants and transport services providers.The importance of business interruption coverIf you would like to be financially protected against certain business risks that disrupt operations, then you need to have business interruption insurance. With this specialised insurance, an insurer — like First for Women — protects your business in the event of financial loss due to a business interruption caused by things such as fires, industrial action or natural disasters.Following a business interruption, your company’s operation either halt or fail to operate at the required capacity. This may happen from when the incident occurs and throughout the recovery phase. If you don’t have business interruption insurance, you will lose revenue.When a business doesn’t generate cash flow due to a business interruption, it is likely to struggle to cover expenses such as payroll, licences, rent and  maintenance. Unfortunately, such a business may have to close its doors, perhaps for good. Business interruption cover can help a company get back on its feet.Business interruption cover is sold separately from business insurance or it may be included as part of a comprehensive package. Take a look at the Complete commercial insurance checklist for businesses so you can be sure of what you will need to keep your business covered. Business interruption insurance: what’s covered?There’s no standard business interruption insurance. Different insurers offer varied business interruption cover, and the level of insurance coverage will depend on your needs.Your policy will have exclusions to protect your business and your insurer. You should know what your insurance coverage includes and excludes before signing the policy agreement to make a successful business interruption claim if you need to at some point in the future. Having said that, it’s important to note that most business interruption insurance policies cover the following: Employee salaries and wages: No business wants to lose key skills when shutting down temporarily. This coverage of employee salaries and wages ensures that this doesn’t happen and allows the business to get back up and running as quickly as possible afterwards.Fixed costs: These expenses include rent payments and operating expenses.Temporary location: A business interruption might require temporarily moving locations to continue operations. Business interruption insurance covers the costs of seamlessly moving and operating at a new temporary location.Profits: Your policy covers profits you would have earned if your operations had continued undisturbed. The amount of profit covered will be based on your business’s previous profits.Taxes: Businesses pay taxes even if they’re victims of business interruption. Your policy covers for these taxes to ensure you avoid incurring costly penalties.Training cost: It’s not unusual for a business to use new and improved machinery following a business interruption event. Your business interruption insurance may cover the cost of training your team on these machines.Loan repayments: Most loans get paid monthly. Lenders expect your business to make good on its promise to pay its loans timeously. A business interruption event might threaten your ability to make these loan payments and thereby tarnish your business’s credit profile. Your policy may make these loan payments to ensure you stay on the good side of creditors.As much as it’s important to know what your business interruption cover includes, it’s also vital to be aware of what’s excluded. The most glaring exclusion is income not included in your business’s financial statements. That’s why it’s essential that you keep your financial records up to date and accurate.Get business interruption cover from First for WomenUnfortunate circumstances can hit your business when you least expect it. The negative impact of the disruption could include revenue losses. Fortunately, First for Women can protect you from such events that force your business into closure.

        "content": "Do you have public liability insurance? Your business faces many financial risks in the course of its operations, making it advisable to have this type of insurance to protect your business against an unexpected public liability claim.First for Women firmly believe every business, small or large, needs this type of business insurance to stay profitable and alive. This article explains all about this type of insurance: what it is, how much of it you need, what it covers, and what it doesn’t cover. What is public liability insurance?Public liability cover is a type of insurance that protects your business against third-party liability due to your business activities. Like all sorts of insurance cover, it may appear unnecessary until an unforeseen event, such as an injury to a customer or member of the public, occurs. At this point, the vital importance of Public Liability Insurance is abundantly clear!A member of the public, who is injured accidentally while on your business premises could sue your business for damages. As a result, you could incur heavy legal costs to defend your business. Even if you can afford those fees, you might still be left with no money to run your daily operations, which could lead to the demise of your hard-earned business.The crucial question to consider is this: “Does my business need public liability cover?” If your business interacts with members of the public, like customers or suppliers, in any way, the answer is an unqualified ‘yes.’Although public liability cover isn’t mandatory in South Africa, there is the risk that a customer or supplier who visits your premises might be injured while on your property. Even though your business may have thorough supervision and good procedures, accidents can still happen.It just makes sound sense to protect your business from such risks by adding public liability cover to your business insurance. If not, your business, especially if it’s a start-up or small business, might become one of the 70% to 80% that don’t see their fifth birthday[1].How much public liability insurance do you need?There’s no public liability cover that fits all types of businesses and scenarios. The risk profile of each business is different, making it hard to generalise how much public liability cover is enough. For example, a plumber faces risk at their customers’ homes while a retailer exposes customers to risk at their own store. The risk profiles of these two types of businesses are different.However, a starting point is to try to evaluate how much compensation you’d be liable for. Factors to consider include the nature of the possible injury, possible consequences of the injury, the resultant loss of income and potential to earn income on the part of the injured party, and the medical costs incurred. It isn’t easy to estimate accurately how much public liability insurance your business needs, however, there’s no doubt that it could be very costly to operate a business without it. That’s why it’s a good idea to speak with a trained First for Women insurance broker to assist with determining the public liability cover that your business needs.What does public liability insurance cover?Like any insurance, public liability cover doesn’t cover every third-party insurance claim. You must be aware of what’s covered under your public liability policy. This type of insurance covers legal expenses and possible compensation relating to damage, loss, or injury to a third party incurred due to:People visiting your business premisesMost businesses interact with a variety of people such as customers, suppliers and salespeople soliciting business. Imagine an individual, such as a supplier, visiting your business premises to fulfil a delivery order. While visiting, they suffer a minor injury on the factory floor. The injured supplier could sue your business for the injuries suffered and for loss of income while they were unable to work. If you have public liability cover, you won’t have to worry about finding the funds to deal with this because you’ll be financially protected. However, if your business is found to be negligent of maintenance or following safety laws, your public liability claim may be rejected. Events organised on your premisesA business that owns large premises might want to generate extra cash by renting out its premises. In some cases, the business may hold events related to their industry, which increases their business exposure to potential customers.To prepare the premises to hold such events, temporary structures – such as advertising boards or a stage – might be required. If one of these structures collapses and injures people attending the event, your business could be held liable. Public liability insurance can come to your rescue in such a scenario.Damage to third-party propertyThere are numerous scenarios under which a business can be held legally accountable for its mistakes that lead to third-party property damages. Here’s an example to illustrate this type of scenario:A plumber visiting a home accidentally bumps a customer’s garage with their company vehicle while exiting the premises, damaging the garage door. The customer sues the mechanic for the damages to their property. If this company has public liability cover, it can claim to cover the necessary expenses.What does public liability insurance not cover?Like motor vehicle insurance, public liability cover does not protect you from every occurrence. Having learned what it covers, it’s as important to know what it doesn’t cover before signing the policy. The following are some of the items this type of insurance does not cover:Injury to company or business workersPublic liability insurance, by design, is meant to protect businesses against third-party claims. By definition, an employee of a company is excluded from the meaning of a third party in this context. Insurance that protects your employees from loss or injury while on duty is called worker’s compensation for occupational injuries and disease (COID) cover[2]Legal judgements and costs arising from professional service or adviceIf you’re in the business of providing professional service or advice for a fee, you could be held liable for any mistakes you make. For example, an accountant who fails to advise a client properly, thus incurring SARS penalties could be sued for the service they provided if the penalties can be directly linked to the advice that was given.Public liability cover doesn’t protect you against this kind of risk. Insurance that does cover professionals, who provide advisory services as a business, is termed professional indemnity insurance or errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance. Examples of the professionals who will benefit from this cover include engineers, financial advisors and lawyers.Rectification of poor workmanshipPublic liability insurance covers third-party damages and loss or injury due to business work carried out. If you complete work that doesn’t satisfy your customer or doesn’t meet industry standards, or fails to meet requirements in the contract, it’s very unlikely this type of insurance will protect you.Legal judgements and costs arising from mistakes made by a company or business directorsNot all companies, especially small businesses, have the financial muscle to indemnify their directors and other officers in the case of a claim against them. Public liability cover doesn’t protect the company or its directors from liability claims due to their mistakes.This is where directors’ and officers’ insurance can come to the rescue. Not only does this type of insurance protect directors and officers financially, but it also covers the company.Get public liability insurance cover from First for WomenProtect your business from third-party claims.

        "content": "Congratulations to South Africa’s female entrepreneurs for being one of the 12 national groups throughout the world to grow during the period from 2020 to 2022! However, South African female entrepreneurs still face multiple challenges, including access to capital and overcoming negative stereotypes. Every woman entrepreneur should consider getting the right business insurance to protect her hard-won entrepreneurial success.First for Women has noticed a significant upward trend in female entrepreneurship. We believe every female entrepreneur needs to know that they have a place in South Africa’s economy.This article will show you that you can win in entrepreneurship and also how business insurance cover can help you along the way.  Female entrepreneurship on the rise in South AfricaOne would expect women to play a more significant role in South Africa’s economy since they make up half of the country’s adult population. Lack of job opportunities, the gender gap, and COVID-19 has had a huge negative impact on the earning capabilities of women. The good news is that with challenges come opportunities. In 2021, South Africa witnessed an increase in female entrepreneurial activity due to increased opportunity-driven and necessity-driven entrepreneurship. According to Mastercard’s Index of Women Entrepreneurs (MIWE)[1], female entrepreneurship jumped from 62.8% in 2020 to 91.2% in 2021 — a staggering growth of 45.2%.There are a couple of reasons for this increased activity rate. For example, political stability improved by 10.5%, while access to venture capital went up by 17.2%. This shows that creating an enabling environment can go a long way towards ramping up female entrepreneurship activity in South Africa.The entrepreneurship landscape showed a ratio of 1 female entrepreneur to 1.52 male entrepreneurs in 2017[2]. The good news is that the ratio improved significantly in 2019, dropping to 1:1.14 — which is a 25% improvement in just two years. This is a sign that the number of female entrepreneurs in this country is rising.Measured on a global scale, South African women entrepreneurs are doing pretty well — being one of only 12 economies that showed growth in female-owned entrepreneurial activity rates from 2020 to 2021/moving up to rank 37th in the world in the world 2021.Why the female business owner is key to economic growthIt may sound like a cliché, but small businesses are the lifeblood of the South African economy. With the country reeling from a COVID-19-increased unemployment rate, an increased number of small businesses could improve employment opportunities.The country is still facing massive unemployment, currently sitting at 33.9%. It’s even more disheartening that the youth — the future of this country — currently face a 46.5% unemployment rate.An increase in female entrepreneurship can help reduce the unemployment rate. The opportunity to do so is high, considering that women-founded small and medium-sized businesses currently comprise only 34% of the total.It’s estimated that female-owned businesses launched in South Africa[3] between 2018 and 2022 could generate up to R175 billion annually. In the process, they could create job opportunities for nearly 1 million unemployed South Africans.Women have business and leadership skills that are not currently being tapped. Additionally, research by Harvard Business Review has found that women outscore men in many leadership competencies. For example, women outranked men in:Taking initiativeDeveloping colleagues or menteesIntegrity and honestyBold leadershipJust imagine the impact increasing the female entrepreneurial activity rate could have on South Africa’s economy!Although female entrepreneurs in South Africa are making progress in closing the gender gap, challenges still persist. They still access fewer business networking opportunities and have limited access to capital and limited mentorship. Why women in business succeed: how business insurance can help themBusiness success is often about leadership. In addition to the leadership skills mentioned, other elements equip women to succeed in business.Women are better communicators: According to Entrepreneur[2] effective communication is the mark of successful business owners. Since women are good at listening, reading nonverbal cues and displaying empathy — essential communication qualities — they can form strong relationships inside and outside of their organisations. From these relationships, they can improve efficiency within their companies and generate sales from their target markets.Women have a higher emotional intelligence quotient (EQ): Running a business involves dealing with various types of people, including colleagues, employees, customers and suppliers. The ability to win people to your way of thinking and being empathetic can lead to business success. This is because you need to connect with staff and customers at a level for them to want to do business with you. Women are good at this, which helps considerably when building a business.Women are better at multitasking: Women are known to function in multiple roles simultaneously and perform them well. For example, they can run their own families, lead religious institutions, hold leadership roles in the community and be effective business owners. Women are not afraid to take risks: Taking financial risks is one of the things entrepreneurs, both men and women, cannot do without. However, the Center for Entrepreneurship has found that more women than men consider themselves financial risk-takers.Women know how to collaborate: There’s an African proverb loosely translated as “No one finger can pick up numerous corn seeds”. Collaboration is necessary for successful entrepreneurship, and women tend to value the input of others.They’re good at negotiating: Successful negotiators understand the needs of the party at the opposite end of the table. Armed with empathy and practical communication skills, women generally win others to their way of thinking more than men do. This gives them an advantage at the negotiation table, which means that they tend to be better at resolving conflicts. Business endeavours fare better because women value fairness.Although women succeed in business because of the above-mentioned qualities, you still must protect your investments. Building a successful business takes money, courage, effort, and time.No female entrepreneur can afford to watch helplessly as her hard-earned investment fails due to unforeseen events. This is where having business insurance is important.5 types of business insurance female entrepreneurs needWhether you run a restaurant, clothing shop, construction company, salon, or accounting firm, you have to consider business risks.

        "content": "Can you imagine if your financed car was written off or stolen and only later you realised that your insurance doesn’t cover the full outstanding debt on your vehicle? It’s not a scenario we ever want you to find yourself in. That’s why at First for Women we offer Auto Top-Up Insurance on our car insurance policies. It’s just one of the ways we try to protect you from financial shortfalls that might come your way.  What is auto top-up insurance, and how does it work? Auto top-up insurance, which is also known as shortfall cover, is a type of insurance policy that protects you against any gap in your existing insurance coverage. What this means is that if your car is stolen[1] or written off, and the amount you owe is higher than what the car is insured for, auto top-up insurance will cover the shortfall you owe. There might be a shortfall because insurers use your car\"s market value to work out what to pay if there is a total loss of the vehicle. The car\"s market value can be less than the finance you still owe on the car. Shortfall insurance bridges this gap between the market value of your car and the finance you still owe. With First for Women’s Auto Top-Up Plus, there are added benefits that you get from this cover. You can upgrade your policy with a deposit protector. With this, First for Women will either pay back the deposit which you paid at the time of purchasing the vehicle or 10% of the insured value of the vehicle at the time of the claim. This will only happen if the vehicle is a write-off or has been stolen and not recovered. Other benefits that you can choose to include are:Excess protectionThis benefit is for when you have a successful comprehensive car insurance claim if your car is written off. With Auto Top-Up Plus, you are given a designated amount to help you to cover the excess that you will have to pay after making a claim. Installment protectionThis benefit helps you pay your car installments while a comprehensive car insurance claim is being finalised. So, if your car is written off and you have made an insurance claim, the Installment Protector Benefit will pay up to two months of vehicle installments until the claim is finalised. Personal accident coverThis benefit covers the policyholder in case you are involved in an accident that results in accidental death, permanent disability, or accidental exposure to HIV. Who should get shortfall insurance for vehicles? Many people believe that if they have comprehensive car insurance, they will be covered for all eventualities – but this isn’t always the case. Because cars constantly lose value as time goes on, the car\"s market value is often less than the replacement value, and you may find yourself with a shortfall if the car is stolen or written off. So, for instance, if you bought your car brand new five years ago for R300 000 and it was stolen today, the market value of your car would be much less than the original price you paid. You may still owe R150 000 in finance on the car, but the actual market value, which is what you would get from your insurer, is R100 000. This leaves you R50 000 short. While auto top-up might not be necessary for every car owner, especially if their car is old or isn’t financed, it is recommended for car owners who: Have a car that is financedAre buying a new carCan’t afford the shortfall Buying a new car is lovely, but the chance of having a significant shortfall if the car is stolen or written off increases when buying your car ‘out of the box’. This is because a new car’s value depreciates as soon as you drive it off the showroom floor. Some estimate the loss to be as much as 20% within the first few seconds of the purchase. Unfortunately, if something happens to your car – it’s stolen or written off in an accident – you will still have to pay the total financing of the vehicle. The way to protect yourself from this happening is to get Auto Top-Up Insurance. It can also assist with monthly installments and with repair costs if the excess is more than you can afford. What are add-ons in motor insurance that you should consider? Just like Auto Top-Up Insurance, there are several add-on insurance policies you could take out in addition to various car insurance policies. All these have extra benefits that can aid you while commuting on South Africa\"s busy roads. Some of the typical car insurance add-ons include:  Tyre and rim guard insuranceWith all the potholes on the roads, the area of your car that is particularly vulnerable to damage is the tyre and rims. With Tyre and Rim Guard cover, your insurer will take care of damage caused by potholes and uneven road surfaces. This cover will allow you to claim the repair and replacement of two tyres and two rims per year. Scratch and dent This type of policy repairs chips, minor dents and scratches on the outside of your car. A second option is an inside-out cover, which takes care of damage to both the outside and inside of the car, such as scruff marks and tears. Get Auto Top-Up Insurance from First for WomenIf your car is stolen or written off, don’t be caught out by an unexpected shortfall. Get a quote on car shortfall insurance with an Auto Top-Up policy from First for Women,  and let us guide you on the best way to protect your financial health.

        "content": "Third-party car insurance is necessary to drive across the borders of countries such as Malawi, Namibia and Botswana. But to travel to many other African countries, you need international car insurance.There are other circumstances where third-party car insurance won’t be enough when driving abroad. First for Women can help you get the right type of car insurance when travelling outside of South Africa.In this article, you’ll learn about what international auto insurance is and when and why you need it.What is international car insurance?Whether you’re driving within South Africa or a foreign country, you’re exposed to risks that can lead to the loss of or damage to your vehicle. It can be very stressful if you have a car accident in a foreign country. Imagine colliding with another car or damaging your tyres! Where do you start with getting help? How would you ensure that your vehicle is safe and gets adequately repaired? Where would you and your fellow travellers sleep if your vehicle can’t be moved? You should consider these questions before setting off on your dream holiday in a neighbouring country. International car insurance ensures that you and your vehicle are protected while driving abroad for personal reasons. In the case of problems such as damage due to accidental collision or loss due to theft, you can claim from your car insurer. Discover more with First for Women’s Insurance for Vehicle’s Guide.However, international auto insurance does not cover you and your vehicle under all circumstances. We will detail what this insurance covers and doesn\"t cover shortly.As with all types of insurance, there are terms and conditions associated with international car insurance. When driving in SADC countries (Angola, Botswana, Congo, Swaziland, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, Tanzania, Zambia or Zimbabwe), you can use your South African driver’s licence. If driving in other parts of Africa, you must hold an international driving permit (IDP). You get this document from the Automobile Association of South Africa[1]. The IDP works in conjunction with your South African driver’s licence. Therefore, you need to have both of these with you. We advise that you keep copies of your original driver’s licence, IDP, and confirmation letter from the Department of Transport.Additionally, you may need to have proof that you’re the legal owner of the vehicle you are driving. If you are driving someone else’s vehicle, you must have a letter of authority from the owner. If your vehicle is financed, you’ll need a letter of authority from your banker confirming this.A First for Women comprehensive insurance; third-party, fire and theft; or third-party only car insurance covers you and your vehicle when driving abroad. But these types of insurance cover only short periods such as holidays. Other conditions will be attached to the cover. For instance, you might be prohibited from driving off-road unless you have also added 4x4 vehicle insurance. Typical car insurance will also limit coverage to certain countries. When in doubt, it is worthwhile to contact your broker to confirm what’s covered and what is not covered by your specific car insurance policy.Why do you need international auto insurance?In South Africa, auto insurance isn’t mandatory. However, third-party liability insurance in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon and Liberia is compulsory. Moreover, car insurance in some foreign countries may include items that are often excluded in South Africa.Irrespective of which country you visit, it’s essential to protect yourself and your vehicle against:Damages to properties belonging to third partiesInjuries or death to a third party in case you’re at faultLoss or damage to your carHaving international car insurance is the safest way to ensure you have adequate cover. Remember also that roads and driving behaviour in foreign countries may not be amongst the best in the world. As such, the chances of being involved in a car accident might be higher than in South Africa. Who should get international car insurance?People who visit foreign countries for various reasons and have to cross borders should have international auto insurance. Some of the people likely to need this type of insurance include:ContractorsHolidaymakersNon-profit employeesHealthcare workersMissionariesIt’s worth checking with your insurance company if you have the right car insurance coverage before undertaking a trip abroad.What countries are covered under your car insurance policy?You don’t need to have international car insurance when driving in all foreign countries. First for Women regular car insurance covers you and your vehicle in many African countries, including: SwazilandZambiaLesothoNamibiaMozambiqueBotswanaMalawiKenyaAngolaUgandaKenyaHaving said this, you still need to adhere to the terms, conditions and limitations of this type of vehicle insurance to enjoy its benefits.If you travel to any other country, check with First for Women to ensure you have adequate car insurance coverage. What does international car insurance cover?How would it feel if your vehicle got damaged in an event not covered by international auto insurance? You\"ll probably feel stressed and devastated. You can prevent finding yourself in this situation if you know what your insurance covers and doesn’t cover. Let’s start with what is covered.Repatriation of your vehicle and its occupants. Your vehicle may break down in a foreign country, and all attempts to fix it may fail. For example, the problem might need to be fixed at a particular facility unavailable in the country where it broke down. For the vehicle to be repaired, it’ll have to be returned to South Africa — a process called repatriation.In some cases, your vehicle may have been involved in an accident that seriously injured you or other occupants. The injured person might need to be repatriated to South Africa for proper medical attention. International car insurance will cover both of these repatriation scenarios. However, the cost of repatriation will be limited based on your insurance policy.Emergencies. An emergency can be one of two kinds: the vehicle might be involved in an accident and need emergency repairs to be mobile again, or the vehicle might have been involved in an accident and subsequently, fail to move irrespective of all emergency repairs made. Fortunately, international auto insurance can pay for emergency transport and accommodation up to a certain limit per day or per incident.Breakdowns. International auto insurance also covers your watercraft or vehicle breakdowns up to a given limit. Your vehicle will be covered for both electrical and mechanical issues, including labour expenses.Loss or damage to your vehicle. Vehicle accidents and theft aren’t unique to South Africa. In many parts of Africa, vehicle accidents are caused by poor roads. International auto insurance will pay out to repair damages to your vehicle or replace it if stolen.What is not covered under international auto insurance? Now that you know what is covered by First for Women’s international auto insurance, it’s just as important to understand what it doesn’t cover.Loss, injury, damage, or third-party liability caused by political or civil unrest are not covered. If a thief steals your vehicle or gets damaged due to events such as martial law, war, strike, or political unrest, your vehicle will not be covered. Neither you nor the occupants of your vehicle will be covered if you sustain injuries due to the activities mentioned above. Business purposes. International car insurance won\"t cover if you use your vehicle abroad for business purposes and it gets stolen or damaged. Business uses include attending meetings as part of your job function or collecting company material such as stock, postage, or equipment.Unauthorised use. Loss or damage to your vehicle may occur because you or an authorised driver left the vehicle’s keys in the ignition or somewhere in it. If an unauthorised person drives your vehicle and causes a collision or hits a pedestrian due to this negligence, this is not covered by international car insurance.  Poor maintenance. There are many reasons that could lead to an immobile vehicle. When the cause of the breakdown is sudden and unforeseen, international auto insurance covers your vehicle. For example, thieves might steal two of your car’s wheels — in which case your vehicle will be covered. If needs be, your vehicle will be repatriated. However, it will not be repatriated if your vehicle can’t move for any reason besides vandalism, mechanical failure, electrical failure, theft, a road accident, or hijacking. Breakdowns due to wear and tear or poor maintenance — such as inadequate vehicle servicing or using an incorrect lubricant or fuel — are not covered.Breakdown due to road unworthiness: if your vehicle is involved in an accident while in an unroadworthy condition, you are not covered.It’s advisable to familiarise yourself with all the conditions that are not covered by your international auto insurance policy. Doing so will help you avoid rejected claims.Vehicles that need international insuranceAs stated earlier, you’ll need to have a minimum of third-party-only car insurance when crossing South Africa’s and other African countries borders. The same can be said about insurance for other vehicles, such as motorcycles, caravans, trailers and watercraft. For this reason, you’ll need to have the right international vehicle insurance when you cross into countries outside South Africa.In the case of caravans, international insurance for caravans protects against loss or damage to your investment due to perils such as fire, theft, or vandalism. If included as an add-on, it also covers contents such as a fridge or bed.Motorcycles, trailers and watercraft (boats) can also be insured against loss or damage while abroad. Ensure you provide all the necessary information about your vehicle to get adequate cover.Get online car insurance quotes from First for WomenIf you travel to other parts of Africa where your regular car insurance does not cover you and your vehicle, it’s a no-brainer to get international car insurance.It all begins by requesting a free and no-obligation online car insurance quote from First for Women.

        "content": "It’s been quite a year for South Africans, and one of the many changes that has had an impact on how we live is rising inflation rates and a higher cost of living. By the end of 2022, the repo rate has increased six times[1] since January, which means credit repayments increased too. To put this into perspective, an R800 000, 20-year bond valued at prime could cost you R1 664 more per month than it did before!If you\"re wondering where the money to cover these rising costs could come from, you should consider qualifying for cash back in the form of a First for Women Insurance no-claim bonus. Read on to find out what this is and how you can access it.What is a no-claim bonus?Insurance might be an essential purchase, but it’s also one you hope you never have to use. After all, nobody invests in insurance hoping that they’ll damage their car in an accident or have someone break into their house and rob them. After years of paying for insurance without claiming, you might feel that it’s an unnecessary expense that you’re better off without, however, this couldn’t be further from the truth. We all need to protect ourselves from unforeseen challenges by having good insurance coverage in place. Even if your monthly insurance costs are low, you’re still parting with your hard-earned money. First for Women Insurance understands this, which is why we offer our clients a cash-back rewards programme. The good news is that if you don’t make a claim for an uninterrupted four-year period, you could get your first year’s premiums or 25% of all your premiums paid back to you.How does a no-claim bonus work?If you’re insured and don’t make a claim on your insurance policy for four consecutive years, you can get your first year’s premiums or 25% of all the premiums you’ve ever paid – depending on which figure is the lesser amount – reimbursed to you as a no-claim bonus. However, this will not take place automatically – you have to opt for the Cash Back Plus option that we offer.Here\"s an example of what this could look like in real life.Ingrid Viljoen takes out comprehensive vehicle insurance with First for Women on her new car purchase. When it’s offered, she signs up for our Cash Back Plus option. She pays R1,000 per month for her car insurance for four years without interruption or making a claim. This means that she pays R12,000 for her first year of premiums and with annual increases collectively spends R55,200 on her car insurance over four years. 25% of her total premiums works out to R13,800 while her first year of premiums is R12,000, therefore it means she can expect R12,000 as her no-claim bonus at the end of the four-year period.There are certain waiver benefits (including our Death and Retrenchment Premium Waiver Benefit) that come with the Cash Back Plus option that could help Ingrid even further. Should Ingrid pass away or become retrenched before she becomes eligible for her no-claim bonus, her payments will be covered for up to half a year without compromising her eligibility for the bonus.Why am I not getting a no-claim bonus?There are a number of reasons you may not be eligible for a no-claim bonus. Here are a few questions to ask yourself:1. Did I apply for the Cash-Back Bonus Option in the first place?Many people assume that you automatically get enrolled in a cash-back bonus programme simply by taking out insurance. However, you’ll need to request this option specifically from First for Women Insurance to activate it and you will also need to make sure it’s noted on your official policy documents.2. Have I made a claim in the past four years?The moment you make a claim, your countdown to receiving a cash-back bonus resets to the specific date of the claim. It doesn’t matter if you weren’t at fault for the accident that required you to make a claim or if the claim falls a few days short of your four-year claim-free period; your four-year waiting period begins again.3. Have I experienced a lapse in coverage?Bounced debit orders can happen to the best of us for a variety of reasons. It could be that your employer changed your salary date or that you moved banks and forgot to switch over your debit orders. Either way, a lapsed premium payment can reset the countdown to your no-claim bonus.4. Is any of my insurance information incorrect?While it’s rare, deliberately or accidentally breaking your insurer’s terms can lead to you losing your bonus and insurance coverage altogether.  An example of this is fronting, which is when a person with a better insurance risk profile (such as a parent with decades of accident-free driving experience) insures a vehicle on behalf of a high-risk individual (for example their 18-year-old child who’s just got their driver’s licence) in order to lower their premiums.How can I get my no-claim bonus? Easy steps to followIf you’re ready to enjoy a no-claim bonus, you might not have to wait four years to do so. Follow these steps and you could have money in your account sooner rather than later – even if you aren’t currently insured with First for Women.1. If you’re currently with another insurer and haven’t made a claim or interrupted your coverage for a period of time, you can request a certificate from them attesting to this.2. Contact First for Women to request switching your insurance. Make sure that your past and present insurance coverage do not overlap and that you have no gaps between coverage.3. Sign up for First for Women’s Cash Back Bonus Programme. If you haven’t made a claim in four years, you could be getting paid before you know it!Get online car insurance quotes from First for WomenAt First for Women, we don’t believe you should have to pay towards insuring your car, home or handbag without experiencing any benefits from it in the long term.

        "content": "There are several types of real estate insurance that real estate companies in South Africa may want to consider to protect their business. First for Women offers business insurance policies tailored to specialist industries, like real estate. Discover what type of insurance is recommended for those in the property industry in South Africa.5 Types of real estate insuranceThe property market has great potential in South Africa, with estate agents dealing with sales and rentals in the business park, industrial and residential categories. Like any other business, it’s important to protect one’s assets, which is why insurance for estate agents is highly recommended. Some critical business insurance policies are needed in real estate, like:     1. Property insurance. This type of insurance covers damage to the company\"s physical assets, such as buildings and equipment, in case of events such as fire, theft or natural disasters. 2. Liability insurance. This coverage will protect the company against claims of alleged negligence or any other liabilities that may arise. This is particularly important for real estate companies, as they may be held liable for accidents or injuries that occur on their property. 3. Professional indemnity insurance. This is important for real estate companies that provide professional services such as property management or agency services. It serves as a type of errors and omissions insurance for real estate and will protect the company against claims of alleged professional negligence or errors and omissions. 4. Business interruption insurance: This coverage will provide financial protection if the business is forced to shut down temporarily due to a covered event, such as a fire or natural disaster. 5. Cyber liability insurance will protect the real estate company against losses resulting from cyber-attacks, such as data breaches or phishing. This is becoming increasingly important for the real estate industry as more and more transactions are conducted online. What isn’t covered by real estate insurance?  Real estate insurance in South Africa, like any other type of insurance, will have exclusions which are events, actions or circumstances that are specifically excluded from coverage under the policy. Some examples of typical exclusions in real estate insurance policies include: Damage caused by war or acts of terrorism[1]Damage caused by pollution or contaminationDamage caused by pre-existing conditions or wear and tearDamage caused by criminal acts committed by an employee or tenant of the propertyLoss or damage caused by the failure of an electronic data processing equipment or mediaLoss or damage caused by failure of power supply or other utilitiesLoss or damage caused by the failure to maintain the property First for Women recommends that estate agents review the exclusions of the policy and ensure that they are acceptable to your business. If any exclusions are particularly important to your real estate business, you may consider adding endorsements to the policy to provide additional cover for those specific risks. Benefits of insurance for real estate companies and agents Examples of how real estate business insurance can be beneficial include some of the following scenarios:  Example 1. Consider a real estate company that had a property damaged by a severe storm and flooding. The company had property insurance coverage, which covered the damage\"s cost, allowing the business to quickly get the property back on the market without any undue delays.  Example 2. What if a tenant of a property owned by a real estate company was injured in a slip-and-fall accident on the property? The real estate company would be liable for the tenant\"s injuries and medical costs. But if the real estate company had liability insurance, this type of insurance would cover the cost of the tenant\"s medical expenses and any legal fees associated with the incident, protecting the company from financial loss. Example 3. Imagine that a fire broke out in a building where a real estate company had its offices, causing significant damage and forcing the company to temporarily close it premises and operations. The business interruption insurance provided by the company\"s insurance policy would assist the business in continuing to operate by covering the loss of income during this time. Find out How business interruption insurance covers you from risk.  Example 4. Consider the implications if a real estate company\"s website is hacked, resulting in the loss of sensitive information and financial loss. The company\"s cyber liability insurance policy will cover the cost of restoring the website and any financial loss resulting from the attack, minimising the impact on business operations.Get a real estate insurance quote from First for Women First for Women offers a wide range of business insurance for both large companies and entrepreneurs.

That&rsquo;s where First for Women homeowner&rsquo;s insurance comes in.Do I need homeowner&rsquo;s insurance for a rental property? Find out more. In this blog, we&rsquo;ll cover everything you need to know about this type of coverage, from liability protection to rental income loss, so that you can make informed decisions about how best to safeguard your rental property as a landlord. What does homeowner&rsquo;s insurance cover for landlords?Being a responsible landlord requires a commitment to maintaining high standards of safety and comfort for your tenants and a willingness to be proactive in addressing any issues. This includes ensuring that the property is in good condition and that your tenants are safe.Some homeowner&rsquo;s insurance policies do not protect you against damages if the property is empty or occupied by a tenant. You need to check the terms of your specific policy. Insurance for landlords, however, will cover the cost of repairs if your property is damaged by fire, vandalism, weather, natural disasters or the tenant. It may also cover public liability if someone is injured on your property. In essence, insurance for landlords will protect you financially if something goes wrong.Read through your policy terms carefully so you know what is and isn&rsquo;t covered. You can usually purchase additional coverage if there is something specific you want to insure against. For example, will the policy cover the loss of income when the property has been damaged and can&rsquo;t be occupied? If you want to know what rental property insurance makes the most sense for your rental property, you can talk to one of our expert brokers at 1st for Women. Do you need insurance for a rental property?Understanding the differences between homeowners&rsquo; and landlord&rsquo;s insurance can be confusing. The simple explanation is that home insurance protects the property owner&rsquo;s personal residence and belongings, and landlord&rsquo;s insurance specifically covers rental properties.Although homeowner\"s insurance is not legally required, protecting your property from various risks and unexpected events is highly recommended. This type of insurance covers losses which can be financially devastating if you are not covered. Evaluating your specific needs and understanding the differences between these types of insurance can assist you in determining which coverage is best for you. Check if you need landlord&rsquo;s insuranceIf you simply rent out your home on a limited basis, you may not require rental property insurance.  For example, suppose you take a few weekend excursions each year and rent your property during those periods. In this situation, your homeowner&rsquo;s insurance coverage may protect you if your home is damaged while you are away.Long-term rental insurance, often known as rental property insurance, is for when you rent out your property for an extended length of time, such as several months or even years.However, every policy is different. So, to secure proper coverage, check with 1st for Women&rsquo;s team of expert advisors to find out which type of insurance is best suited to the length and type of rental you are planning. Check the duration of the homeowner&rsquo;s insurancePolicies are only intended to cover the property where the owner lives; they do not cover holiday homes or long-term rentals. This sort of insurance is not appropriate for vacant properties for most of the year. Certain coverages are required in such instances to provide adequate protection for the property. For example, empty residences require a separate insurance policy, whereas landlord coverage is required for properties rented long-term to tenants. For this reason, looking into specialist insurance options that provide appropriate coverage for your specific needs is essential. Personal property inclusionsHomeowner&rsquo;s insurance protects against loss or damage to the physical structure of your home, but not necessarily the household goods inside it. Moving items such as furniture, curtains, home appliances, and clothing must be covered under home contents insurance. This insurance is designed to cover personal property against loss or damage caused by accidents such as theft, burglary, fire, malicious damage, and/or natural disasters like storm and flood damage. The homeowner&rsquo;s insurance does not cover the tenant&rsquo;s personal property, so it&rsquo;s good to warn your tenant that they need to get this coverage for themselves.Personal property insurance policies provide homeowners with coverage up to a certain amount. So, remember to review your policy regularly to ensure that you have adequate coverage for your personal belongings and to update the policy whenever you acquire new personal effects.  Homeowner&rsquo;s insurance and public liabilityLiability coverage is typically included[1] in all standard home insurance policies. Homeowner&rsquo;s insurance usually covers the policyholder and their relatives who live on the insured property; it sometimes extends to friends who are visiting. Liability coverage is intended to protect the homeowner if someone is injured on their property and they are found legally responsible. If you, as the homeowner, are sued, this coverage can help pay for medical expenses or legal fees. However, it is important to note that liability coverage limits may differ depending on the policy and the insurance company. Reviewing your policy carefully and regularly and considering additional coverage if necessary to ensure adequate protection during an unexpected disaster is critical.Landlord\"s insurance typically only includes liability coverage for the rented premises and if a tenant is injured on the property and the landlord is legally responsible. Several laws, most notably the Rental Housing Act and its amendments[2], regulate the rental market. You should be aware of these laws as a landlord. The Rental Housing Tribunal[3] will settle disputes under the terms of this Act, which regulates the relationship between landlords and tenants. It was implemented to safeguard the rights of both the landlord and the tenant. Cover for property structure and detached buildingsIn South Africa, homeowner\"s insurance typically includes cover for the property structure and any detached buildings on the property. This type of coverage protects the property\"s physical structure, including the walls, roof and foundation, against damage caused by inclement weather, like fire, lightning, winds, hail and other natural disasters. For example, you will be covered if there&rsquo;s a hail storm and your windows are broken.Detached buildings such as garages, sheds or workshops are also covered under this policy, although the level of coverage may vary depending on the policy and the insurance provider. Some homeowner\"s insurance policies may provide a set amount of coverage for detached buildings, while others may offer additional cover options for these structures.It\"s important to review your policy carefully to understand fully the scope of protection offered for the main house and any detached structures. Considering the value of the property and any detached buildings on the property, it\"s also essential to ensure the level of coverage is adequate for your unique needs. Having the right insurance for detached buildings and property structure is necessary for safeguarding your investment in your house and property. Having the appropriate insurance coverage can assist you in recovering financially and getting back on track in the event of unforeseen events, such as extreme weather or other natural disasters. It&rsquo;s important to remember that homeowner&rsquo;s insurance does not cover moveable items in your home or detached buildings. The difference between loss-of-use and loss-of-rentUnder South African law, loss-of-use and loss-of-rent are two distinct legal concepts that relate to damages that a property owner may claim.Loss-of-rent coverage protects landlords financially if a covered loss, such as a fire, flood or another natural disaster, renders their rental property uninhabitable. The purpose of coverage in these situations is to replace the lost rent that the landlord would have received from the tenant when the property is unusable. Loss-of-use insurance will cover the costs of the tenant relocating while the damaged or destroyed property is repaired or rebuilt.

        "content": "In 2022, an estimated 68 stolen cars[1] were reported to the SAPS daily in South Africa. With many businesses requesting that their employees return to the workplace and cease working remotely, there\"s a chance that the number of cars on the road (and by extension, the number of hijackings) will increase.While there\"s no way to predict if or when you might experience this crime, being mentally and physically prepared could help you recover more quickly or prevent it. Discover more as 1st for Women explains what you should know about hijackings or the theft of a motor vehicle, its impact on stolen car insurance claims and how First For Women car insurance can come to your aid.The state of carjackings and car theft in South AfricaThe South African Automotive Authority[2] (DEKRA) says that a stolen car every 22 minutes. The theft of a motor vehicle often occurs between 06h00 and 19h00 on Thursdays and Fridays. However, hijackings can take place. It can be a crime of opportunity as you travel down a poorly lit road or involve hijackers targeting specific vehicle makes and models.It may seem that hijacking news and reporting do more to stoke fear than help you practically address your safety concerns. Knowing how you should react in this situation can help manage your fears and better prepare you to make a stolen car insurance claim.What to do if you\"re carjackedThe following tips can help you keep your cool and minimise the fallout of a dangerous hijacking situation.1. Before/during a carjackingThe best thing you can do for yourself or anyone with you during a hijacking is to stay calm. This means complying with the hijackers, provided their requests don\"t compromise your safety further. Move as far from the car as possible without resisting or addressing their efforts. If you must remove a child from the backseat, communicate your intentions clearly and keep your hands visible. Don\"t attempt to retrieve your belongings unless instructed to do so.2. After a carjackingOnly once the hijacker and your vehicle have moved away from you should you start moving. Get to a safe place (maybe a busier road or petrol station) and request help immediately. Alert anyone who would be wondering about your whereabouts. If possible, write down what you had in your car, when the accident took place, where it took place and any details about the hijackers that you can remember.You must contact the police as soon as possible to report the incident and what was stolen. Your next priority will be to cancel any stolen bank cards or identity documents, and if you had to leave house keys in your vehicle, change the locks as soon as possible.You may need to visit a police station to report the incident in person. Ensure you do this as soon as possible, as you\"ll need a police report for insurance purposes.3. What to do (and not to do) during a carjacking●    Don\"t escalate the situation by antagonising the hijackers, resisting them or trying to pursue them. ●    Don\"t keep it to yourself. Hijacking is traumatic and you may need to talk to a friend or therapist about it to come to terms with it and move forward.●  Do look out for notable details that could help to identify your hijacker later. This includes unusual scars or facial features, clothes or details of the hijacker\"s car number plate, make and colour.●   Do commit the story of your hijacking to paper as soon as you can and in detail. Once the adrenaline wears off, you may forget several key details.What to do if your car is stolenDealing with the theft of a motor vehicle may seem overwhelming. Here\"s what you can do:The minute you realise your car has been stolen, make a note of the incident. This will include your location and when you last saw your car, and the condition it was left in. This information should include any belongings left in it when it was stolen.Gather all the important documents, including copies of your ID and driver’s licence; details of your car — make, model, mileage and registration number — and any photos you have of it and your insurance policy. Once you have everything, call the police or visit a police station to relay details of the incident; then do the same with your insurer. Preparing yourself beforehand will help this process go more quickly and smoothly.You will be given a case number from the SAPS to follow up on. However, the more time passes without news, the less likely your car will be recovered. Make sure you familiarise yourself with your car insurance policy so you know the next steps to replace it or receive a payout. Remember that if you\"ve financed your car, the outstanding amount will need to be settled before you receive a payout.Discover more about How to file a car insurance claim if your car is stolen. How to reduce your carjacking or car theft riskThe following tips can reduce your risk of having your car stolen:●    Don\"t dawdle: Whether entering or exiting your car, avoid taking your time checking your messages or selecting a radio station. ●    Double-check: After locking your car, always check if it\"s locked. Car jamming can prevent this, leaving your car accessible to potential thieves.When driving, always lock your doors and keep your windows up.If possible, drive in the centre lane rather than one of the side lanes.If you believe you are being followed, drive to the nearest police station.Be aware: it\"s tempting to tune out your surroundings during long commutes. Instead of blasting music loudly and fiddling with your belongings, be aware of what\"s happening outside your car.Plan your commute: If you\"re visiting an unfamiliar area, familiarise yourself with the route beforehand. This will keep you from getting lost or distracted by your GPS.Pull over safely: If you need to pull over for any reason, do so in a safe, public and busy place.Lock it up: Avoid making your car an attractive prospect by locking up all your belongings in your boot, out of sight of passersby.Car insurance for theft and carjackingsThe best thing you can do for your peace of mind is to take out an appropriate level of car insurance cover. This will depend on many factors unique to your lifestyle, budget and the car in question. For example, a brand-new convertible will require high coverage and may require you to use specific anti-theft measures. An older car may not warrant this level of coverage, meaning you may have to make plans if you replace your car with a newer model.

        "content": "Do you want a lower car insurance premium? You can with an improved credit score and get affordable car insurance. It begins with knowing which levers to touch to improve your credit score. With this article, 1st for Women aims to shed light on all the important aspects of credit scores. You will learn about what a credit score is and discover what a good one is and why it’s important when getting insurance.What is a credit score, and why is it important?Have you ever been denied a credit card or a loan? Has your bank ever declined to increase your credit card limit? If you answered yes to any of these questions, the reason is probably a lower credit score.A credit score is a three-digit number that estimates the likelihood of paying back credit taken from financial institutions. Lenders use it to gauge your creditworthiness and estimate your risk as a borrower. Your credit score is in your credit report, a record of all your credit accounts, payment history, new credit inquiries and other details.There are a couple of credit-scoring methods, of which the most popular is FICO[1]. This scoring model, like the rest, uses your credit report information to calculate your credit score. FICO scores range from 300 to 850, with lower scores indicating a high probability of defaulting and higher scores suggesting that you are a  reliable payer.The information in your credit report originates from lenders who send your payment record to credit bureaus. The four main credit bureaus in South Africa are TransUnion, Compuscan, Experian and Xpert Decision System (XDS).Each credit bureau sends borrowers’ payment records to these credit bureaus every 45 days. It’s from that information that your credit score is calculated. You are entitled to one free credit report from each credit bureau annually.It’s not only lenders who use credit scores. Landlords, employers, and insurance companies use them. For instance, insurance companies can use them and other factors to figure out your insurance premium.Without a credit score, it would be hard to access many financial products. For instance, you can’t get a credit card and may desperately need to handle a financial emergency such as hospitalising your loved one.If you want a credit score, all you need to do is open a couple of credit accounts. Opening these accounts is important when you can use credit responsibly because misuse could ruin all aspects of your financial life.You don’t just want to have a credit score. It must be a good one. And what is a good credit score? It depends on the scoring model being used. In the case of FICO, a credit score higher than 700 is considered good, while 800 or more is excellent. The higher the credit score, the better the credit terms you are likely to receive.Credit score and insurance: do you need a credit score to get insurance?Yes and no. A credit score is related to your insurance. A low credit score may lead to higher insurance rates or premiums. If you default on your insurance premiums, your credit score may receive a hit.Insurance companies gauge how risky you are to insure by including your credit score among the factors to calculate your risk factor and insurance premiums. For instance, when you apply for car insurance, the insurance company will look at your age, where you park the car at night, your claims record, your driving experience, and your credit record to come to an insurance premium.Insurers look at your credit score to help them understand how risky you are to them. It follows that having a good credit score will help you get better insurance premiums. This would save you hundreds of rand over the period of a year. You could use those savings to add to your investments or other purposes.Why is a credit score used for insurance premiums?Companies like FICO and LexisNexis calculate credit-based insurance scores and normal credit scores. However, these insurance scores rely heavily on your credit report. As a result, the factors that impact your credit score will also influence your insurance score.Does credit score affect car insurance? Let’s answer that question this way: say that you recently made a couple of late payments on one or two of your credit accounts. The next time you check your credit record, you will find your credit score has taken a knock. If you apply for insurance such as auto insurance, you’re likely to pay higher premiums. And if you had to apply for insurance, you may be denied if your credit score is poor. To assess your risk, insurance companies evaluate the same factors as lenders, including:Hard inquiries: When you apply for credit, lenders perform hard enquiries or credit checks on your credit report. The more of these enquiries lenders make, the harder your credit score gets knocked down. Most importantly, frequent hard enquiries suggest you’re not on top of your finances.Payment history: This is a huge factor on the credit score calculation. It tells the lender how well you’ve made payments in the past. Lenders will look for missed payments and whether you pay timely or late.Amount of available credit you use: This is called credit utilisation rate. The more available credit you use, the harder it can be to stay up to speed with your payments. Hence, a high utilisation rate may lead to higher insurance premiums.Average length of your credit: This is the average age of your credit accounts. The longer it is, the more favourable you look in the eyes of insurers.Types of credit accounts: A variety of credit accounts and a good payment history suggest you have a good grasp of credit. As a result, you could be treated favourably by insurance companies.6 ways to improve your credit score &amp; reduce insurance premiumsSince your credit score influences your insurance premiums, improving it can reduce them. There are proven approaches to this, including the following:Keep your payment history up-to-date: If you’ve never made late or missed any payment, keep it up. However, you can still reclaim and improve your credit score if you make timely payments and never miss payments. This will go a long way towards improving your credit score because this factor greatly influences it.Reduce your credit card balances: Doing this will reduce the amount of credit you have used and drop your credit utilisation rate. As a result, your credit score will receive a boost.Keep old credit accounts open: Older accounts increase the average age of your credit history. The older the average age of your accounts, the better your credit score if all the other factors are good.Limit new credit applications: A hard enquiry causes a drop in your credit score. Doing many credit applications within a short period greatly hurts your credit score. When you limit making new credit applications, there will be fewer hard enquiries, and your credit score will stay strong.Check your credit report for errors and rectify any mistakes: Lenders can send wrong credit information to credit bureaus. For instance, they may mistakenly claim you missed making a payment and get a hit on your credit score. Checking your credit report regularly can minimise errors like this and more.Use a credit monitoring service: identity theft is real and can go undetected for months to years, according to TransUnion[2]. Signing up for credit monitoring service can prevent it from damaging your credit. When someone uses your identity to apply for credit, you’ll receive an alert and act timely.Get affordable insurance premiums from 1st for Women Lower insurance premiums save you money over the long term.

        "content": "As a business owner, whether you’re a seasoned entrepreneur or just starting out, you know that unexpected events can happen at any time. From natural disasters to lawsuits, these events can threaten the survival of your business. More often than not, it’s not a matter of whether something will happen but when it will happen. At First for Women, we understand insurance for business and what a daunting task it can be to find affordable yet comprehensive coverage that meets the unique needs of your business. This blog aims to provide valuable insights into factors to consider when choosing business insurance and how to lower business insurance costs so that your business is properly protected without breaking the bank.Understanding what type of business insurance cover you needProtecting your business is a top priority, and having the right insurance in place is crucial. However, navigating the different types of insurance available can be overwhelming, and determining the coverage you need can be challenging. As a broad guideline, you need to avoid under-insurance[1] and ensure that you have sufficient coverage to protect your specific business.If you\"re wondering what sort of insurance for business — or a combination of different commercial insurance products — is right for you, here are a few considerations to help guide your decision. First, examine the type of industry you’re in and the potential business risks involved. Consider the employees who work for you and how they could be affected if something goes wrong. Lastly, assess the assets in your possession that are essential for the operations of your business and make sure they’re protected.1. Know your risksBefore you start shopping around for business insurance, it\"s important to understand the business risks you face. This will help you identify the types of cover you need.2. Shop aroundOnce you’re aware of your business risks, you can start shopping for the right insurance policy. First for Women offers insurance coverage designed to meet the needs of women in business and female entrepreneurs. 3. Read the fine printWhen you\"ve found an insurance policy that meets your needs, be sure to study it properly before buying it. This will help you understand exactly what your policy doesn\"t cover. 8 tips to manage business insurance costsAs a business owner, you are always looking for ways to reduce costs and save money. When it comes to insurance, there are a few things you can do to help manage your costs.1. Look for comprehensive insurance packages Business insurance can be a costly investment for any business, but it is important to remember that insurance is an essential part of successfully running a business. There are several different types of business insurance, and it\"s important to choose a policy that covers all of your bases. One way to save on business insurance costs is to look for comprehensive insurance packages. These types of policies will often cover various risks (for example, business interruption insurance and public liability insurance) so you can be sure that your business is protected. Another benefit of these types of policies is that they can often be customised to fit the specific needs of your business. When shopping for business insurance, it’s sensible to compare quotes from various insurers. This will help you get the best possible rate on your policy. You should also consider the coverage options that each insurer offers before making a final decision.2. Look for business insurance group rates Business insurance group rates refer to the premiums offered to a group of businesses that are part of an association or organisation that has negotiated a group insurance policy with an insurance provider. The group policy typically covers a specific type of insurance, such as public liability or property insurance. It offers a lower premium rate than if each business were to purchase a policy independently.The insurance provider may offer group rates because they can spread the risk across many businesses, leading to lower premiums. Additionally, group policies may have standardised coverage and underwriting guidelines, which can simplify the insurance process for both the insurance provider and the businesses.Group rates can benefit small and medium-sized businesses that may not have the bargaining power to negotiate lower rates independently. However, you need to review the terms and coverage of a group policy carefully before committing to it, as it may not meet all of your specific insurance needs.3. Get help from a business insurance brokerWorking with a broker or insurance consultant who can help you to manage your business insurance costs better  in several ways. First for Women has a great team of experts ready to help you build your business insurance portfolio. They have access to a wide range of competitively priced policies, which means you can compare different coverage options and find the best fit for your business needs at an affordable rate. They also understand the complexities of the insurance market, so they can provide advice on how to structure your policies for maximum benefit and cost savings. 4. Change your insurance deductiblesChanging your insurance deductibles can help manage your insurance costs by giving you more control over what you pay out of pocket when a claim is made. You can increase or decrease the deductible amount, resulting in lower or higher premiums. Increasing the deductible means the premium will be lower; however, if a claim is made, the cost to your company will be higher because more money will have to be taken from your company\"s cash reserves. Decreasing the deductible increases premiums while decreasing the funds needed for claims should one occur. By choosing an appropriate level of risk tolerance, managing deductibles can help your business manage financial exposure while balancing cost savings opportunities through affordable coverage options.5. Modify your insurance payment methodThere are several different insurance payment methods available. Some of the most common payment methods include the following:Annual payment: This is the most traditional and straightforward payment method for business insurance. The policyholder pays the entire premium for the year upfront, and the policy remains in effect for the duration of the policy term.Monthly payment: Some insurance providers may offer the option to pay premiums every month. This can help businesses spread out the cost of insurance over the course of the year.6. Ensure your business has a good credit ratingA good credit rating[2] can help reduce insurance costs, as some insurers use it to determine the risk of insuring a particular business. Insurers may consider a business\"s credit score when calculating premiums; businesses with better scores often receive lower rates.Ensure your business pays its bills on time and in full each month. Monitor your credit record regularly for any discrepancies or errors that could affect your score. Manage lines of credit responsibly by not taking out more debt than you can reasonably afford to repay in a timely manner. 7. Minimise business risksMinimising your risks can lower your premiums by decreasing the likelihood that the insurer will have to pay out on a claim. When insurers perceive that the risk of losses or damages is low, they will typically offer lower premiums than if higher levels of risk are involved. Additionally, taking preventive measures and implementing safety protocols to minimise risks can demonstrate an increased level of responsibility on behalf of the business owner, which could result in lower premiums.8. Evaluate insurance rates annually to ensure the best option Evaluating your insurance rates annually allows you to compare prices and coverage options. This helps you find the best option for your business\"s current needs, budget and risk profile while ensuring that you are not overpaying for unnecessary coverage or missing out on important protections.Get a business insurance quote from First for WomenManaging your business insurance costs is a critical part of running a successful business.

        "content": "While many women know how to change a flat tyre or drive in rainy conditions, there may come a time you\"ll need roadside assistance for something more serious, like a flat battery or an electrical problem. The Guardian Angel on Call is a benefit of First for Women car insurance. We encourage women drivers to prepare themselves for unexpected situations with a roadside survival pack and knowledge about preventing or managing a crisis or car problem. Be prepared for roadside emergenciesDid you know that South Africa has the tenth-largest[1] network of roads on Earth? Despite being geographically smaller than many other nations, our country features roughly 750,000 km of road &mdash; with only about 20% tarred roads. Many roads have potholes, exposed rebars, cracks, or compromised barriers. The average driver could encounter their fair share of roadside emergencies because of these conditions.Essential items to have in your carWhile there\"s no way to predict when or if you ever need roadside assistance, you can rely on the First for Women Insurance Guardian Angel on Call benefit to assist with vehicle emergencies. However, you can prepare for these issues by having certain essentials in your car. This can also be useful when you\"re stuck in traffic or taking an unexpected trip. Here are some ideas to get you started:Car essentials can include a tow rope, spare tyre, jumper cables, tyre iron, breakdown beacons and a reflective vest.Healthcare essentials &mdash; you can use a first aid kit or pack individual items such as bandages, plasters, disinfectants, gloves and tweezers. You can supplement this with items specific to your family\"s needs, such as an adrenaline injector for someone with allergies or glucose for someone diabetic.Communication essentials &mdash; ensure you have enough cables, chargers and power sources to keep your devices functional and compatible with your vehicle and device type. Choosing battery-powered devices can be a good idea if your car shuts down.Comfort essentials &mdash; keeping shelf-stable snacks and drinks in your car will keep you comfortable in the event of a breakdown, as well as blankets or gloves in cold seasons. You can also keep books, playing cards or games to stay occupied.An absolute must-have &mdash; although we hope you&rsquo;ll never need it &mdash; is a fire extinguisher.Basic car maintenanceYou can prevent car problems with preventative maintenance to keep your car in a good condition. It can be helpful to create a maintenance schedule with detailed reminders. Keeping records will also help prove that you\"ve done what\"s necessary to maintain your car if you need to sell it. Here\"s what a car maintenance schedule can include, bearing in mind that the checks required and frequency thereof can differ according to your car\"s condition, age, make and model, and driving patterns. Some tasks you can perform yourself, while others are best left to professionals.Short-term maintenance tasksThese are performed according to your service booklet/car manual, before a long trip or after a period of inactivity)Check oil, transmission, brake fluid and coolant Check the air filter or air conditioning systemCheck tyre pressure, alignment, and tread depth &mdash; and don\"t forget about the spare wheel Remember to rotate the tyres for optimal useTest lights (including headlights, brake lights and parking lights)Long-term checks, repairs or replacementsThese are performed according to your service booklet/car manual&rsquo;s annual service.Shocks and struts Spark plugs Drive beltDifferentialsWipersBatteryBrakesRoad and car safety precautionsIt\"s easy to forget detailed rules of the road when you\"ve been driving for years or take the same commute route daily. However, keeping these rules in your mind can prevent breakdowns and accidents and limit your liability if an accident happens or affects other drivers. Here are some guidelines to follow:Ensure all the passengers in your vehicle wear seatbelts and that children of appropriate ages use car seats.Double-check your visibility and blindspots when pulling in or out of a space or changing lanes or direction.Follow the traffic signs, even if other drivers don\"t so.Use a hands-free kit for cellphone calls and resist texting (it&rsquo;s illegal), even if you\"re in standstill traffic.Keep valuable belongings in your boot or out of sight.Maintain a safe travelling distance.Reduce speed in poor driving conditions. Use your hazards and pull over when you detect an issue with your car.Avoid antagonising or confronting other drivers who drive poorly or break the law, as this can compromise your safety.Use ride-sharing services when you drink &mdash; do not drink and drive!How to change a flat tyreDespite your best efforts, you may encounter situations you can\"t prepare for. However, practising the steps below can give you peace of mind and confidence so you\"re prepared for one of the most common causes of a roadside breakdown &mdash; a flat tyre.When you suspect a flat tyre, stop at a safe location, turn on your hazards, or place an emergency triangle if visibility is poor.Remove your tools and spare wheel from your boot.Apply a wheel wedge to the tyre opposite the one with a puncture to keep it from rolling, and use a jack to lift the car at least 10 cm off the ground.Use a wrench anticlockwise to loosen the tyre nuts before removing them and the wheel cap.Switch the tyres, replacing the flat tyre with the spare, before inserting the nuts back in and tightening them with a wrench.Carefully lower the car, then place the damaged tyre and tools in your boot.Guardian Angel on Call for roadside assistanceIf you have First for Women car insurance, you have the bonus of access to Guardian Angel on Call, which can offer you around-the-clock roadside assistance via a dedicated phone app. This app can detect collisions and automatically dispatch emergency help, allowing you to order and track a tow truck to your location and have someone come to you to wait or help you get back on the road again.Get First for Women car insuranceIf your current insurer doesn\"t offer you car insurance with roadside assistance, it may be time for you to switch to First for Women car insurance.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Would you like to pay lower car insurance premiums? If the answer is ‘yes’, finding out how to lower your car insurance will definitely interest you. At 1st for Women, we know how important your car is to your life, family and work. Car insurance has become a wise investment. Discover how car security systems and devices can help lower your premiums.  The reason insurers care about car securityA car is an important asset for busy women. Your car is your go-to for the morning school run, work route, running errands, and so much more.  Imagine how you would be inconvenienced if you lost your car through theft! The shocking reality is that over the period 2018-2022, car hijackings[1] increased substantially in South Africa.If your car is stolen and is not retrieved after a police investigation, you will have to file a car insurance claim for a stolen car. Insurers welcome methods to prevent car theft; better security is important in calculating car insurance premiums.  Why a security feature helps lower car insurance premiumsThere are several factors that car insurers consider when calculating a car insurance premium, including:Age of driver: The older you are, the lower your premiums because you are considered a lower risk. Car make and model: High-end luxury car brands tend to attract a higher insurance premium.Driving record: A good driving record and few car insurance claims also help lower premiums.Where the car is parked at night: A car parked overnight in a locked garage behind a locked gate is more difficult to steal. If your vehicle is securely parked, you can get lower premiums.Consider two car owners with similar cars, and everything else about them is the same — except one of the cars has an anti-theft device installed. Suppose that these owners apply for car insurance from the same company. The overall risk will be lower for the car with the anti-theft device, which could result in lower car insurance premiums.  The best car anti-theft devicesWhen shopping around for a car anti-theft device, make sure that you choose one approved by the Motor Vehicle Security Association of South Africa[2] (VESA). VESA is the custodian of manufacturing and installation standards of car security systems. Here are some security systems to consider: Car alarmThe car alarm is one of the most popular anti-theft devices. It comes in two versions: a silent and an audible alarm. A silent alarm notifies a security company or the car owner. An audible alarm goes off in the immediate vicinity. Typically car alarm systems integrate both a silent and an audible alarm. They consist of the following:Sensors, switches and detectorsA radio receiverA computer control unitA sirenA backup batteryWhen someone tries to open a car, sensors and detectors pick up the disturbances. Depending on the setup, the computer control unit turns the alarm on and may also flash the headlights.Car immobiliserAnother popular car security system is an immobiliser. The purpose of an immobiliser is to prevent your car from moving if certain actions are not undertaken. An immobiliser uses a receiver and a transponder in the car’s ignition. When you start the engine, the car requests a signal from the key. If it receives the correct signal, it allows the engine to start. GPS tracking devicesWhile car alarms and immobilisers are meant to prevent car theft, GPS tracking devices are helpful for recovering a stolen vehicle. It’s a good device to combine with a car alarm or immobiliser for added car security.When you install a GPS tracking device, it connects with multiple satellites to pinpoint the location of your vehicle. GPS tracking devices are available as active or passive trackers. Active GPS trackers provide a real-time view of your car’s position. If your car is stolen, you can activate it to receive assistance as quickly as possible. A passive GPS tracking device stores your car’s location data. An operator will need to view it at a later stage. Some of the well-known GPS tracking device providers include the following:Netstar: For vehicle tracking and stolen vehicle recovery, Netstar is a reliable provider. Not only has this company been in this industry for more than two decades, but it also offers protection against signal jamming.Tracker Connect: Popularly known as Tracker South Africa, this company offers vehicle tracking and recovery solutions. Beame: This provider offers easy-to-install tracking devices plus vehicle tracking solutions. It’s a good company if you’re looking for a budget-friendly car-tracking option.Cartrack: Offers real-time vehicle tracking and recovery services. Matrix: This is a top choice for vehicle-tracking devices. It offers real-time tracking, panic buttons and warning theft alerts.Mechanical locksAnother type of anti-theft device is a mechanical lock, which includes both steering wheel and gear stick locks.  Steering wheel lock: This metal rod connected to the steering wheel requires a key to unlock it. The steering wheel cannot be turned unless it’s unlocked. Gear stick lock: This equipment locks the gear lever in one position, usually in neutral. If thieves try to steal your car, they can’t move it because they cannot engage the gears. Similarly to a steering wheel lock, you need a key to unlock the gear stick lock. Car security camerasCar security cameras provide two functions: visibility around the car and security if paired with sensors. These cameras work like dashcams. With dashcams and GoPros, you can capture footage of a security alert. The most effective option for vehicle security is a car security camera connected to sensors. You can receive alerts on your phone. With this information and footage, you can quickly report the incident and receive assistance.

        "description": "",
        "content": "If you’ve just bought a new vehicle, then the best kind of car insurance to have is comprehensive car insurance. There are good reasons for this.At 1st for Women, you’re a part of our family, so we want you to have the right protection for one of your important assets—your vehicle.This article clearly shows why you should opt for comprehensive coverage, what it covers, and the extra benefits of this type of insurance. Let’s get started.What is the meaning of fully Comprehensive Car Insurance?The idea behind any insurance is to protect you financially. This is the case with car insurance. There is a powerful reason why it’s termed comprehensive: it covers the widest range of risks, such as: Loss or damage to your vehicle due to car accidents or collisions, damage from the elements such as, vandalism, theft (or hijacking) and fire.Third-party claims in case you’re liable for damages to someone else’s property.Car insurers like 1st for Women include additional benefits, like emergency medical assist, roadside and accident assistance, reliable towing services and storage at no additional cost.What does fully comprehensive insurance cover?As mentioned above, comprehensive vehicle insurance protects your vehicle against many eventualities that lead to damage or theft of your vehicle. Let’s go over the details of what this insurance plan covers.Accidental damage cover to your vehicle. Accidents and collisions cause expensive damages. If you incur vehicle damage, whether it’s your fault or not, comprehensive car insurance will cover your vehicle.Third-party liability claims: Sometimes, you may accidentally damage someone else’s car. For instance, you may accidentally reverse into your neighbour’s car on a misty morning. Theft and hijacking of vehicles: If this does happen to you, rest assured that it’ll either be recovered or replaced. Damage caused by fire or natural elements. The weather can be unpredictable. Hail damage, for instance, can cause a lot of damage to your car. Imagine driving on a highway; an oncoming car overtakes and enters your lane. Seeing no way to avoid the accident, you go to the shoulder of the road. Unfortunately, you lose control of the wheel, and your car veers off the road, damaging a farmer’s electric fence.Your car also suffers some damages, including the front bumper and several scratches and dents on the bonnet and sides.If you have comprehensive car insurance, you won’t worry as your car insurer will pay out for the repairs to your car. Moreover, it will cover the cost of replacing the farmer’s fence.If, however, you have third-party only car insurance, your car insurer would cover the expenses of repairing the farmer’s electric fence. You’d have to pay for the damages on your own vehicle. Suppose you have recently purchased a new vehicle. In that case, it’s advisable to protect your investment with the best possible cover available, which is why insurers recommend Comprehensive Car Insurance cover. Why you need comprehensive coverage for a new vehicleBuying a new car comes with the responsibility of protecting your asset in the event of unexpected events and risks. Paying out-of-pocket to repair or replace a car can be very expensive. For many car owners, having comprehensive coverage can be the difference between living a debt-laden or debt-free life.When you buy a new car through financing from a bank or financial institution, you’ll be required to get comprehensive insurance[1]. The financial institution wants to ensure it does not lose money if the car gets damaged or stolen.  Additional benefits of comprehensive insuranceMany car insurers provide additional benefits to comprehensive insurance policyholders. The most common include roadside assistance. Other insurers, such as First for Women, go the extra mile to ensure their clients have unparalleled peace of mind.1st for Women’s offers exclusive benefits for Comprehensive Vehicle Insurance policyholders, some of which include: Guardian Angel on Call: We provide a roadside assistance benefit, Guardian Angel on Call. This is a 24/7 service where stranded motorists can request help that can be accessed by downloading our app.  Guardian Angels Lifestyle Assistance: This service assists you with various lifestyle-related services at home or on the road. For instance, with Concierge Assist, you get assistance with dentist’s booking, flight booking, travel information and handyman arrangements.Value add-ons. If you would like added support, you can add value add-ons to comprehensive insurance, like tyre and rim insurance or scratch and dent. With Scratch &amp; Dent, you’ll keep your car’s paintwork shiny and attractive. Auto Top-up covers shortfall expenses. Tyre &amp; Rim insurance helps you keep your car’s tyres in tip-top shape. This is welcome, considering the damage potholes cause on many of South Africa’s roads.Get a Comprehensive Car Insurance quote from 1st for WomenYou can start the process here if comprehensive insurance sounds like a good fit for your needs.

        "description": "",
        "content": "You may have purchased a used car recently, inherited one from a family member or driven one you\"ve owned since university. However you came to own it, you\"ll know that you\"ll need insurance for older cars in South Africa from a provider that recognises the unique factors accompanying owning a used car. As the provider of car insurance for old cars, here\"s what 1st for Women wants you to know. Defining an older car South Africa\"s pre-owned car market is booming[1] for good reason. Local sales figures show that in 2022 annual used vehicle sales increased by up to 43% compared to the previous year &mdash; exceeding the number of new vehicles traded by more than 200%. Discover more about How to buy a second-hand car with confidence.  Before you consider your old car insurance options, it helps to know what insurers consider an older car &mdash; bearing in mind that these factors are subjective and may differ between insurers. Age &mdash; Age impacts various car makes and models differently, with some completing their life cycle after a few years and others accumulating value in time as vintage models. Generally speaking, any car over a decade old is considered old.Mileage &mdash; Mileage ages a car, even though some cars can remain in relatively good condition if they have been looked after. If your car has clocked up over 100,000 km on the road, you can consider it old because of wear and tear.Technology and features &mdash; Decades ago, automatic windows, built-in GPS systems and airbags weren\"t common features in cars. Today\"s car models will come standard with features that previous models didn\"t have. Your car may be considered old if it lacks certain features that have become commonplace in the market. Condition &mdash; Proper care and maintenance can extend your car\"s lifespan. A 2020 city hatchback that\"s missed its service intervals and been driven poorly will be in a poorer condition than a 2015 model that has been well maintained.Popularity &mdash; While some vehicle brands are tried and trusted in South Africa, many brands enter and exit the market annually. A car from a discontinued brand may warrant a higher premium than one with a local presence, as it would be challenging to service the former or find replacement parts for it. At the same time, the more popular brand will have technicians and spares readily available when needed. 3 Factors to consider when buying insurance for older cars Now that you know whether your car is considered \"old\", here are some factors that could impact the monthly premiums accompanying your insurance for older cars in South Africa:1. Your car&rsquo;s valueIf you\"re driving a high-end or sought-after model, its higher market value may mean that it qualifies for a higher premium compared to insurance premiums for other older cars.2. Your past and present driving habitsHigher-risk driving patterns and behaviours can impact your premiums. For example, if you commute long distances daily, you might expect to pay a higher premium than someone who only uses their car infrequently. If you have a history of filing claims or have had several car accidents, this can increase your risk level and premiums.3. Your chosen coverageDepending on your budget and needs, you can choose various coverage levels. For example, comprehensive insurance for older cars will cost more than third-party-only coverage. Is it cheaper to buy insurance for older cars?The good news about driving an older car is that you can generally expect to pay lower premiums across the board for the following reasons:Depreciation &mdash; As time passes, all cars lose value, which will result in a lower premium.Risk &mdash; As your car becomes older and is replaced by newer and more advanced models, its risk rate for theft decreases. Coverage &mdash; New cars tend to have a higher value and are more likely to be financed. This means comprehensive insurance is often a legal requirement, which may not apply to older cars not financed with a bank.Affordability &mdash; Used cars tend to have lower repair and part replacement costs.While these factors generally apply, there\"s no guarantee as to what premium you will have to pay, as this will depend on your unique risk profile, your insurer, and the vehicle. When choosing insurance for older cars, you should consider the coverage you\"ll most benefit from.You can opt for: Comprehensive coverage, Third-party Fire and Theft Insurance or Third-party Only Insurance. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to consider getting a Pre-owned Vehicle Warranty, if your car is second-hand.  Will an older car qualify for insurance?Your used car will usually qualify for insurance without any problems. However, you may not qualify for insurance for an older car in the following circumstances:It\"s in poor condition: It may be both financially and practically unfeasible to repair a car that\"s experienced multiple failures, and therefore it will only qualify for limited coverage.It\"s been written off: A car that\"s sustained damage that the insurer believes is too costly to repair may not qualify for full coverage. Any car that\"s been written off in an accident or declared unroadworthy won\"t qualify for insurance. Get car insurance for old cars from 1st for WomenDriving a used car shouldn\"t limit your options &mdash; you deserve the peace of mind that aligns with your needs and budget. 1st for Women can offer you this, and we invite you to apply for a quick car insurance quote online today to find out how we can help you get insurance for old cars.

        "content": "Having the right kind of insurance is essential for car owners seeking protection for their vehicles. Third-Party Fire and Theft Car Insurance from 1st for Women is well worth considering amongst the provider’s available insurance options. Discover more about this type of insurance as we provide information about the pros and cons of Third-Party Fire and Theft Insurance so you can make an informed decision about insurance policies.Factors to consider when taking out Third-Party Fire and Theft As a starting point, you need to understand how Third-Party Fire and Theft Insurance works, which may affect your decision. This insurance policy will cover any damage your vehicle causes to a third party’s vehicle only; the policy does not cover damage to your own vehicle unless caused by fire or theft. Determining which car insurance policy most closely suits your needs hinges upon various factors. Some key considerations include:Your personal risk profile is an important consideration. You might consider Third-Party Fire and Theft Insurance if your level of risk is low and you are confident about your driving skills.Budget constraints. When faced with financial limitations, it is better to have some insurance coverage than none at all. The cost-effectiveness of Third-Party Fire and Theft Car Insurance can be a great benefit.Car age and value. Third-Party Fire and Theft can provide adequate protection for older vehicles or ones that aren\"t financed by a bank that require comprehensive insurance. Finally, it is important to consider driving habits. It may be more cost-effective to purchase Third-Party Fire and Theft Insurance if you are retired or don\"t frequently drive since it provides essential coverage without the added costs of comprehensive insurance.Pros of Third-Party Fire and Theft Car InsuranceWith the South African Police Services (SAPs) reporting a total of 5,119 car hijackings during the first three months of 2023, which translates to approximately 57 cars stolen daily[1], Third-Party Fire and Theft car insurance has many benefits.Cost savings are one of the key advantages of Third-Party Fire and Theft Car Insurance policies since they usually have lower premiums than comprehensive policies, making them a more affordable option.This insurance also covers loss or damage caused by fire, theft or hijacking of your vehicle, which is a real risk and can be financially draining without adequate coverage.Third-Party Fire and Theft Insurance policies also include liability protection, providing protection against unexpected expenses resulting from accidents you caused.In the case of theft, someone may steal your car, which is later found with substantial damage. With Third-Party Fire and Theft Car Insurance, such misfortunes will not leave you completely out of pocket as it assists with covering repair expenses and remuneration options in the event of total loss declarations by insurers.  Cons of Third-Party Fire and Theft Car InsuranceIt’s important to keep the disadvantages in mind, too. There are some restrictions on the coverage offered by this policy. Most insurance plans cover fire and theft damage, but do not cover accidental damage to your own vehicle.You should also pay attention to any exclusions and limitations in the fine print and the limited coverage scope. Some policies available on the market today do not cover certain vehicles or types of usage. Always check the policy carefully before deciding to sign up.Lastly, choosing Third-Party Fire and Theft Insurance could result in higher out-of-pocket expenses for repairs or replacements as it does not cover your vehicle in the event of a car accident or collision.  6 Tips for making the right decision when buying car insuranceTo ensure you choose the best car insurance for yourself and your particular needs, consider these useful suggestions:1. You should first evaluate your personal requirements in relation to your budgetary constraints so you can get what suits you best without compromising on important aspects you need.2. Along with individual risk, consider how much coverage you need to be financially secure in the event of a car crash. Your previous driving record and the likelihood of accidents are also important considerations. In addition, the area where you work and live ‒ where you park your car most of the time  ‒ must be factored in.3. Once you have determined these factors properly, it’s time to get quotes from different insurers. 4. It can be very helpful to compare the overall benefits of policies from different providers. 5. If you are still unsure, you can seek professional advice from an insurance expert who can help outline which policy is the best fit.6.

        "content": "October is Breast Cancer Awareness month in South Africa – and according to CANSA, apart from certain types of skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women of all races, with a lifetime risk of 1 in 33 women in South Africa contracting the disease.1We all think it will never happen to us, but with a statistic like that, we can’t afford to be complacent – and while we might have solid life insurance cover and medical aid, the costs of cancer are as much emotional as they are financial and we owe it to ourselves and loved ones to take precautions and protect ourselves as much as we can. Luckily there are some simple things you can do to take care of yourself and help reduce your risk of contracting breast cancer… The first thing you can do is get checked – or check yourself, regularly!  The key thing in increasing good outcomes when it comes to a breast cancer diagnosis is early detection – according to the South African government about 90% of patients survive for many years after diagnosis when breast cancer is detected at the early stages.2CANSA recommends yearly screening through a mammogram of all women over 40 (whether or not you have symptoms or a family history).  Self-examination is also key – and you need to do it regularly in order to ensure you understand what your breasts normally feel like – that way you’ll notice any abnormality more quickly.  To find out exactly how to examine your breasts properly, click here. According to CANSA these are the signs to watch out for: A puckering of the skin of the breastA lump in the breast or armpitA change in the skin around the nipple or nipple dischargeDimpling of the nipple or nipple retractionAn unusual increase in the size of one breastOne breast unusually lower than the other – nipples at different levelsAn enlargement of the glandsAn unusual swelling in the armpits Getting active reduces your risk… moderate physical activity reduced breast cancer risk by 14%, while “vigorous” physical activity reduced breast cancer risk even more – 25 percent.3Eating those veggies is as important as you think it is!  Foods rich in bioflavonoids can have a protective effect against breast cancer – so make sure you’re eating lots of brightly coloured fruits and veggies, including beans and legumes!3Swapping your wine for a cuppa could be worthwhile.  Studies have shown that drinking two or more units of alcohol a day increases your breast cancer risk by at least 20%. And the American Cancer Society now recommends that women enjoy one serving or less of alcohol a day. Drinking Green Tea on the other hand has the opposite effect, as its ingredients are known to inhibit the free radicals thought to facilitate early cell changes that can lead to cancer.3Taking Vitamin D supplements can help.  Many studies have shown that women who have breast cancer also have low levels of vitamin D – and this is particularly true for post-menopausal women. Get your daily dose of sunshine or pop a vitamin D pill… you’ll be protecting your breast health.4So in honour of Breast Cancer Awareness month, don’t just wear a pink ribbon – make a pledge to take care of yourself and do the things you can to stay healthy.  Oh, and get yourself screened too.  The people who depend on you will thank you for it – and if there is something wrong, detecting the signs early could save your life!  CANSA runs Care Centres in all provinces in South Africa and will charge you according to how much you earn. Call them Toll-Free on 0800 22 66 22 or email them at info@cansa.org.za or visit www.cansa.org.za to find your nearest Care Centre."

This year, women, men and dogs will be uniting at Steyn City,  Dainfern, to make their protests heard loud and clear: we will not stand for woman and child abuse. The 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters Protest Walk with Jacaranda FM coincides with South Africa’s 16 Days of Activism, which begins a few days following the walk, and runs from 25 November to 10 December 2015. The first Sisters with Blisters took place in November 2006 and started because South Africans needed a platform where they could stand up and say, ‘Enough is enough!’ about woman and child abuse.In the years from 2006 to 2014, Sisters with Blisters has raised R3 070 000. These much-needed funds go to charities such as Women and Men Against Child Abuse, and the Department of Social Development’s White Door Centre of Hope, in an effort to put a stop to abuse of women and children in South Africa, and to aid survivors of abuse. 1st for Women proudly sponsors this protest walk so that we can add our voice to the thousands of Gauteng residents who won’t tolerate woman and child abuse. As many of our clients know, one of the core areas of focus for the 1st for Women Foundation is to provide funds to charities aimed at helping victims of gender-based violence (GBV). This protest walk is another way for us to help South African women and children overcome abuse, whether it’s preventing GBV on a community level, strengthening the services of our criminal justice system, or providing care and support to survivors.We encourage all of our clients, their friends, and their families to participate in this year’s 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters Protest Walk with Jacaranda. Entries open on 17 October and close on 10 November 2015. Tickets can be purchased on the Sisters with Blisters website. The walk starts at 8am, and registration takes place on 20 November 2015 between 14h00 and 20h00, or on the day between 06h00 and 08h00 at Steyn City.

        "content": "Breast cancer impacts the lives of many women. In South Africa, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and it is dedicated to educating and encouraging women to get clinical breast exams and take control of their breast health. Every day, we face challenges that we have no control over – it’s why we ensure that our families are taken care of with life insurance policies – but when it comes to breast health, you can stand up and give yourself the health care that you need and deserve. 1st for Women recently conducted a survey on the Mamahood Facebook page with over 2 200 participants to find out how South African women feel about this dreadful disease and if they’re taking care of their breast health. We asked questions such as whether or not the respondents have ever had a clinical breast exam, how often they have one, and if not, why this is the case. The results show that there is still much to be done in terms of educating South African women on the importance of having breast exams and encouraging them to undergo the exam on a regular basis. It is recommended that women have a clinical breast exam every one to three years from the age of 20, and every year from the age of 40. However, only 64% of the respondents said that they follow this advice. Moreover, 27% of the respondents have never had a breast exam at all. Our survey further revealed that, of the women who have never been for a clinical breast exam, 14% of them don’t perform self-exams at home, either. Considering that breast cancer is the most common cancer among South African women, it’s clear that we should be doing more to promote regular breast health check-ups. What is more concerning than the number of women who are not getting regular exams are their reasons for avoiding them. When asked why they don’t go for clinical exams, certain responses came up repeatedly, such as:“I’m too scared.”“I’ve never had breast problems.”“A healthy lifestyle can overcome breast cancer.”“I can’t afford it.”Executive Head of 1st for Women, Robyn Farrell, had this to say:“It is understandable that some women may be scared of the breast examination process, but it is so much better to be examined and to get a clean bill of health or benefit from early detection.” Farrell goes on to say: “The misconceptions that healthy living prevents breast cancer, that you have to wait until a problem presents to get examined, or that you have to pay for breast care are worrying indeed.”Farrell further states that breast cancer can happen to any woman at any age, which Cansa confirms, stating that, while women with a family history of breast cancer are at increased risk, as well as those who consume alcohol, women at any age, with any kind of lifestyle, and with any previous history can get this dreadful disease. When it comes to getting screened and examined for breast cancer, there are a number of inexpensive ways to do this in South Africa:Cancer Care Centres provided by Cansa. They charge you for an exam according to how much you earn. There are also Cansa’s mobile health clinics if you or someone you know lives in a rural area.Government hospitals that will charge you based on your monthly income.During October you can visit the Radiology Society for a free screening. Have a look on their website to find out where you can get screened for free this month.Part of taking care of your health involves knowing the symptoms of breast cancer. Below are some of the ways your breasts may change in shape, feeling, or appearance. If you notice one of these signs, make an appointment to see your doctor immediately:Puckering of the skin of the breast.Lump in the armpit or breast.Nipple discharge.Change in the skin around the nipple.Unusual size increase in one breast.Enlarged glands in the breasts.If you still have worries about having regular clinical breast exams, consider that while just under 2% of our 2 200 respondents said that they have been diagnosed with breast cancer, 44% said they have a friend or family member who has. Breast cancer affects many South African women, which is even more reason to have regular examinations. With clinical tests and early detection, South African women can overcome breast cancer. If you’re struggling with this disease or know someone who is, you can find helpful information about women’s health on the Cansa website.“As a woman, so many people depend on you to take this advice to heart and find the courage to get tested. Early detection can save lives, and examination and treatment is within your grasp,”says Farrell."

        "content": "“The security of the woman is the security of society.” – Atifete Jahjaga. We’re happy to report that this year we held another successful Sisters with Blisters Protest Walk. This was the 10th anniversary of the event, which saw 5 000 women, men and pooches walk 5km together at the majestic Steyn City to show that they will not tolerate the abuse of women and children.The protest was about more than just walking 5km; it was a way for people of all walks of life from all parts of the country to come together to show solidarity with survivors of abuse. That’s why we’d like to say thank you to all of our walkers, whether in heels or flats, and both two- and four-legged! With your help, we raised R400 000 which was equally divided between two charities: the Department of Social Development’s Hlayisani Centre of Hope, and Women and Men Against Child Abuse. The money donated to the Hlayisani Centre of Hope will go towards providing temporary shelter for abused women and children in KaBokweni, Mpumalanga, where they do not have readily available access to clinics and police stations. The funds for Women and Men Against Child Abuse will help the organisation to continue their work towards fighting for the rights of abused children. This year, the walk took place just before the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children campaign, which kicks off on 25 November and finishes on 10 December (which marks Human Rights Day around the globe). This international awareness campaign aims to highlight the importance of putting an end to the abuse of women and children and draws attention to how it affects many people all over the world. In addition to sponsoring Sisters with Blisters, 1st for Women helps abused women by donating a portion of our clients’ monthly premiums to the 1st for Women Foundation, which is involved in a number of activities that aim to put a stop to gender-based violence and help survivors of abuse get justice. The Foundation does this by focusing on three core areas:Community-based prevention services. Our partners run workshops in various communities to open a dialogue between women, men, NGOs, government, schools, churches and other local stakeholders, where they raise awareness on gender-based violence, provide accurate information on how the law protects women and children, identify the causes of gender-based violence, and sometimes they can mobilise a forum which can lobby for improved service provision regarding gender-based Strengthening services within the criminal justice system. This extends to the SAPS, where our partners have helped set up victim-friendly rooms within stations, regularly train officers on helping victims with respect and kindness, and more. We strengthen the medical system, where our partners provide 24-hour service at some Thuthuzela Centres so that victims receive attention as soon as possible. We aid victims in the court system, where some of our partners give legal support to victims to make sure that protection orders are secured, criminal cases are pursued, and much more.Care and support services to survivors. We support various organisations that provide support services such as counselling, shelter accommodation, and more.Thank you again to all of the attendees at the 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters Protest Walk with Jacaranda FM who are as committed to ending abuse against women and children as we are. You are an inspiration to us!"

        "content": "As 2016 draws to a close, reflecting on your year past can serve as a guide on how to go into 2017 with your best foot forward. December is the perfect time to reflect and look back on everything that has happened during the last 12 months.Have a look at some amazing South African women who have grown into the best versions of themselves through hard work and perseverance, and the lessons we can all take away from their experiences that can help us confidently step into the new year:The story: Turning passion into a business 24-year-old Lebo from Pretoria started her own nail polish business called Malia Nail Care in her mom’s house, and just four months after that, guests at the South African Music Awards were excited to receive her innovative homemade nail care products as part of the gifts bags.The young entrepreneur admits that one of her biggest challenges this year has been getting her product distributed to various salons and spas because these entities are highly brand-loyal. “Being loyal is a good thing, but it doesn’t make room to introduce upcoming brands”, said Lebo. “I don’t see it as competition; I see it as expansion – being open to the new”, she said in an interview with a popular South African women’s magazine.The lesson: Keep your eyes steadfast on your goalLebo’s story teaches us that as long as you have full faith in your dreams, nothing can stand in your way of achieving what others think is impossible. You first need to set clear goals for yourself, then work hard at achieving them and be prepared to face the challenges that come your way while on your journey to reaching your goals.The story: Dedication and loyalty always pay offNancy, a mom to 2 sons, has worked as a domestic worker for over 10 years. Her oldest son just finished writing matric this year and her youngest celebrated his first birthday in October.  As a domestic worker, she has singlehandedly put her son through school and is also helping her youngest sister through university. Because of Nancy, her sister is the first in their family to go to university. This has been one of Nancy’s biggest achievements thus far, and it is one we’re excited to celebrate with her!The lesson: Be persistent in the pursuit of a better life Nancy’s story is one of perseverance. No matter what your circumstances are in life, you should always be persistent in working towards the goals you have set for yourself. Women possess an inherent strength that can make anything possible.The story: Putting South Africa on the international photography mapFrom a young age, Nadette knew she wanted to be a photographer. After finishing school, she landed a job assisting a commercial photographer while studying at university. She soon had her own clients, and over 15 years in the industry, her client-base has included big names in the magazine and advertising industry. “My passion has always been beauty, fashion and stills photography” says Nadette. Her biggest highlight in 2016 has been launching her first exhibition at Le Meridien St Julians Hotel &amp; Spa in Malta, Italy.The lesson: Do it with passion or not at allNadette’s story serves as a great example of how any dream can be turned into a reality as long as passion accompanies perseverance. However big or small your dream is, staying persistent while following your passion could turn out to be greatly rewarding. These examples of every day women doing incredible things in their lives should serve as inspiration for every woman in South Africa to become who they are meant to be, to persevere even amidst the challenges that come with each passing year, and to believe in their inner greatness. At 1st for Women, we will continue to put you first through our tailor-made insurance products and services so that you can continue to deliver on all the demands of your world, knowing that we are here to support you every step of the way.

        "content": "Improving the quality of your life might be overwhelming when you think of all the things you’d like to change, however it needn’t be. As the old saying goes, “the longest journey begins with a single step” – and just a few small changes every day can help boost your well-being and make your days more meaningful. We’ve come up with some very small things you can do easily and quickly, and which, when added together can make a meaningful change in your life.  All the inspiration you need to live better, is right here… And you can start today.Drink more water: Everybody knows the value of hydration, you’ll have more energy, your kidneys will function better, and your skin will thank you. Find a bottle, carry it round in your handbag. If you have it, you’ll drink it.Recycle: The feel-good factor here is huge, you’re saving the planet with your one small step.Spring-clean just one shelf or a cupboard at a time: Putting your home or workspace in order is amazingly revitalising. You don’t have to devote a day to the task.  Just a few minutes here or there while you’re waiting for the kettle to boil, and you’ll be amazed at how much you get through after a while.  Order is calming and you’ll soon be able to find the things you need when you need them.  If you donate the stuff you no longer need to a good cause, you’ll feel even better…Limit your screen time: Read a book instead, preferably a paper one. Studies show that people who spend less time on social media like Facebook or Instagram – are happier1. It’s also been proven that looking at your phone before you sleep can impact negatively on the quality of that sleep2.Get up 20 minutes earlier: It sounds counter-intuitive, but having a little me-time before the mad rush of the day starts can leave you more ready to face the world. Spend the extra time in the garden with a cup of coffee, or just breathe, or meditate.Tell the people you love that you love them, regularly: They’ll tell you back – and we all need to know how important we are to the people that matterSay ‘No’ more: Even if it’s just to one thing you would usually say ‘yes’ to.  We’re programmed not to want to let people down, but when we take on too much for that reason, we’re letting ourselves down.  You’ll be surprised how willing people are to accept the ‘no’ – they don’t want to overtax you, really.Keep a calendar somewhere prominent: It’s all very well to have an electronic diary but if you transcribe your weekly activities onto a tangible one, it helps you keep track. And there’s so much satisfaction in crossing things out!Do something for yourself, however small – once a week. Take a walk on the beach, take a pottery or pilates class, go to a movie alone, even just take the time to dry your hair properly. Giving yourself permission to have even a little space just for yourself can be so relieving and so energising.Find a charity you believe in, and support them: Doing good makes us feel good.  You don’t have to donate cash – share info about your cause on Facebook or by talking to people, support a fair or raffle they might be holding, donate stuff you’re no longer using to them. There are so many ways to help, in any small way you can.Deal with each email as it comes in: If you’re not going to read it, delete it right away. If you are, read it then and there. Create a filing system in your inbox, where you can keep the things you need to, and then trash things you don’t need – having a backlog to go through is always daunting and makes you feel like you’ll never get on top of things.Ask for help: No-one is an island. You may not realise how many people are willing to help you until you ask. Ask a friend to lift your child, ask a family member to babysit, ask your spouse to do the dishes. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, asking for the help you need – and getting it – can really lift the burden.http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/staying-off-facebook-can-make-you-happier-study-claims-a6728056.htmlhttps://sleep.org/articles/ways-technology-affects-sleep/"

        "content": "The first two Saturdays of March 2018 proved that when people unite, incredible things happen. We hosted our annual 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters walk, in partnership with East Coast Radio and Jacaranda FM, and together, we successfully made a real difference in the fight against woman and child abuse in South Africa.On Saturday 3 March, 2 000 Durban residents descended upon Chris Saunders Park in Umhlanga to show their support for women at the 5km walk, in partnership with East Coast Radio. On this day, R80 000 was raised and donated to the Centre for Community and Justice Development, a non-profit organisation which provides fundraising, training, research and other support services in KwaZulu-Natal in the fight against woman abuse.The very next Saturday, about 3 500 men, women and children from Johannesburg united and showed their support at St Stithians College in Sandton. Together with Jacaranda FM, we raised over R270 000, which was donated to Lawyers Against Abuse, as well as Women and Men Against Child Abuse, both of which are making a tangible difference within their communities in the fight against woman abuse.This year, the theme for the walk was ‘together, let’s #giveabusetheboot’. When we come together, through our collective efforts we will be able to find solutions to give abuse the boot, for good. Woman abuse is a social tragedy which has reached epidemic proportions, not only locally but globally too, and it urgently needs to be addressed so that women are empowered to go forward together and live their best lives.The walk is dedicated to uplifting, advancing and empowering women from all walks of life. It’s about creating awareness and giving South Africans an opportunity to speak out, be heard and change their destiny positively. At 1st for Women, we hope that through the walk, we were able to inspire others to do just that. We have to do it together, because together, we are stronger.The annual 1st for Women Sisters with Blister walk forms part of a holistic solution which we implemented at the start of 16 Days’ of Activism in 2017. We also launched ForWomen, our online platform which consolidates woman abuse fighting efforts in one place. The initiative was launched to address the three pillars of support against woman abuse, namely prevention, preparation and provision. In addition, the 1st for Women Foundation has raised over R56 million, over the last 12 years, in the fight against women abuse. Read more about this incredible initiative here."

        "description": "",
        "content": "For the last five days we’ve remembered and honoured the lives lost to woman abuse. But remembering is not enough. We have to take action, action that makes a sustainable difference and action that inspires and creates hope – and we’ve turned to the immense power of words and music to do this… starting with just one word: fearless.For us the word fearless is not the absence of fear, but the courage to push through and prevail despite it, to live the lives we’ve always wanted. We believe so strongly in the power of this word that we created an exclusive statement T-shirt with designer Palesa Mokubung and our brand ambassador, Zozibini Tunzi. This got us thinking that if one word can hold so much gravity, imagine the power of many impactful words, coupled with something just as powerful – music.Songs are far more than just words to a tune. Songs captivate us, shape our thoughts and opinions, influence, and guide us. In fact, our very brain chemistry is affected by music.According to leading neurologist, Oliver Wolf Sacks “The power of music and the plasticity of the brain go together strikingly, especially in young people.” It’s no wonder then that popular music has a profound impact on the way we view the world and our place in it, through connotations and connections it builds in our minds.Now, think about the music that blares through the radio on a daily basis, the music that pops up on top hits in our playlists, that repeats on radio five times a day, the music that climbs the charts, the songs that get stuck in our heads. The tunes are often so catchy, that we don’t even pay attention to the lyrics themselves.While music has immeasurable power to do good and make a positive impact, it can also have the opposite effect.Hip Hop – a genre which is extremely popular and widely consumed – unashamedly objectifies women in song lyrics and the portrayal of a misogynistic lifestyle. It desensitises individuals to sexual harassment, exploitation, abuse, and violence toward women” and “legitimises the mistreatment and degradation of women” (Adams &amp; Fuller, 2006, p. 953).In a country where a woman is murdered every three hours, where 1 in 4 women are victims of domestic abuse, 1 in 3 women will be raped in her lifetime and where 52 420 sexual offences were reported in just 365 days, we cannot afford to exacerbate the situation further with music that propagates the idea that any form of woman abuse is acceptable.So, we asked: What can we do to change the tune and help bring an end to woman abuse?Our answer? Considering that music has the capacity to do so much good, we want to harness that good to bring about much-needed change to the attitudes, behaviours and beliefs that condone woman abuse through the power of song.Introducing 1st for Women’s My Body (Stand Up) song – a song that saves women’s lives.We breathed new life into the original My Body song, written by educational psychologist Peter Alsop, and taught in schools worldwide as part of a sexual abuse prevention programme. We carried through the song’s themes such as consent and boundaries, and relaunched it as an inspirational, edutainment anthem with a strong call to action. The song encourages women to rise up, walk hand in hand and take a stand against woman abuse.  It reminds men and boys to do the same and put women first – no means no.To help us bring our vision to life we collaborated with some of SA’s best-known artists. It is an honour to work with incredible women who share in our unwavering support of the fight against woman abuse. From Lira, Jules (GoodLuck), to Gigi Lamayne and Mariechan, as well as our brand ambassador, Zozibini Tunzi, each one of them is using their voice to amplify our message and to spread the message of My Body (Stand Up) far and wide. To bring our song to life visually, we also called on dancers who share our passion for the cause. They jumped at the opportunity and participated in our music video as a public service announcement – bringing together real people for a real cause.But it doesn’t end here. We need you to share the message and raise the volume even higher, so that the world is singing along to the song that saves women’s lives.By downloading our song, you are making a tangible difference in the fight against woman abuse – ultimately helping to save lives. That’s because proceeds from all downloads go to the 1st for Women Foundation, which has raised R81 million for woman abuse causes to date. The money raised from My Body (Stand Up) will go towards our community programme in Diepsloot which focuses on the prevention of woman abuse and is supported by response initiatives that provide critical support services to victims of abuse.Now that you know just how important your download is, it’s time to take action.Stand up against woman abuse. Download the song that saves women’s lives now: http://ditto.fm/mybodystandup. Here are a few reasons you need our song on your playlist:It’s a cool and catchy song, with purpose and meaningIt features incredible South African female artistsIt’s the song that will be heard wherever you go this summerAll proceeds go to the fight against woman abuseYou join a community of women supporting womenUltimately, there is strength in numbers – the more voices we have, the louder the message and the bigger the difference we can make. In the words of Nelson Mandela: “Music is a great blessing. It has the power to elevate and liberate us. It sets people free to dream. It can unite us to sing with one voice. Such is the value of music.”"

        "content": "The lockdown in reaction to COVID-19 has forced many women and children into constant close proximity with their abusers.  Globally, lockdowns are causing an increase in domestic violence and abuse.  In Hubei province, domestic violence reports to police have more than tripled. Tunisia has reported a five-fold increase in violence against women. In Northern Ireland, there’s been a 20% increase of domestic abuse reports and in Paris, there’s been an increase of 32%.  South Africa is not immune and recently, a 75-year-old woman was brutally raped and strangled by suspects posing as SANDF soldiers. As a result, The South African National GBV Command Centre (0800 GBV GBV) has been inundated with calls.  To assist those on the frontline, 1st for Women Insurance has donated headsets, hand sanitisers, masks, gloves and debriefing services to all social workers and supervisors at the GBV Command Centre to reduce secondary traumatic stress and burnout.Nomathemba Malvern, Deputy Director: VEP &amp; GBV and GBV Command Centre Manager expressed sincere gratitude for the donation, saying that it has gone a long way in ensuring that the GBV Command Centre working environment is conducive, healthy and safe for the employeesThe Command Centre social workers and supervisors are doing a tremendous job in helping keep women safe in a time when heightened stress and anxiety exacerbate already volatile situations – with the looming threat of potential loss of income and bored and restless children stuck at home. According the World Health Organisation, some of the other issues that women face during isolation are:Reduced contact with a support system of friends and loved ones who may usually offer care, guidance and even protection in violent situations.Increased dependence on women for the caring of children, spouses and the household. This is further exacerbated by extended school holidays.Disruption in employment or loss of jobs means less access to basic needs and services, further aggravating situations of violence and conflict. Another result of scarce resources is the increased risk of economic abuse at the hands of their partner.More ways for an abusive partner to inflict control and power over women through the restrictions imposed during lockdown, giving women even less access to services, help and support in this time.Abusers may go so far as to restrict access to vital items like soap and hand santiser. They may even exert control through sharing incorrect and inaccurate information and updates about the COVID-19, creating more fear and stigmatising their partner.Considering that in South Africa, it is estimated that one in two women experience violence perpetrated by an intimate partner and three women are intentionally killed by their intimate partners each day – the issues women are facing, as mentioned above, put them at even more risk at this time.Lindiwe Zulu, Social Development minister is urging communities to report incidents of women and child abuse during the lockdown.We further encourage those seeking assistance and advice to visit ForWomen, our online support network that brings relevant causes and women abuse survivors together."

We’re inspired by their tenacity, resilience, dedication and unwavering commitment to others. Each week we focus on a different woman in our #HeroineOfTheWeek series on social media. Below is a snapshot of some of their amazing stories, so far:Ncumisa Adams – this Medical Technician heard the reports of a virus in Wuhan, China, late last year, and immediately sprang into action. She started a pathology lab that was ready to test for COVID-19, even before the global pandemic hit. From the start, her mission was clear: to “help the sick, especially from disadvantaged backgrounds.”Charlotte Raubenheimer – for iron-strong will and dedication matched with a soft and generous heart, look no further than Charlotte. She completed an Ironman in her backyard during lockdown. She tested her stamina and endurance for a good cause – raising funds to buy a wheelchair for a disabled community member.Samela Matiso – heeding the president’s call, entrepreneur and tailor of 18 years, Samela, used her skill to continue making a living, while keeping South Africans safe. The enterprising Samela makes about 50 masks a day, which she sells through Facebook and WhatsApp.Linda Mlanzeli Baleni – when COVID-19 hit, Linda Mlanzeli Baleni’s sewing, supplying and catering cooperative shut down. But thanks to Linda’s ingenuity, they quickly reopened – switching from making school uniforms to making masks. Not only did her business survive but her 34 staff members kept their jobs and are keeping food on the table.Dr Retshidisitswe Kotane – desperate to start her career and join the fight against COVID-19, this enterprising and innovative medical student used crowdfunding to raise the money she needed to complete her studies and graduate. She has also earned a position in the response team at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases.Maria Botha – music is the rhythm of the soul, just ask Maria. Her NPO, MuziKidz, has kept the sound alive, with virtual violin lessons. MuziKidz gives lessons to children in Khayelitsha, Nyanga, Gugulethu and Delft. Since 2015, over 250 children have benefited from this incredible initiative – and for those currently enrolled, the learning continues.Keep an eye on our social media as we continue to share more of these inspiring stories, in our #HeroineOfTheWeek series."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Girls have traditionally been raised to be caring and nurturing, attributes not considered required life skills for boys. On the contrary, in some homes, they’d be considered negatively as ‘soft’. Generations of boys were encouraged to hone so-called manly attributes, to fit the stereotypical male profile.Seems we were quite wrong.Parents are key contributors to a child’s understanding of, and reaction to, the world. For a boy to become that caring, kind person, he not only needs to witness and experience his parents walking that talk…he needs to know they really value those attributes.HAPPINESS OVER CARING?Today’s parents are a far cry from the hands-off ‘seen-and-not-heard’ version of yesteryear. They’re far more involved in their children’s lives, and concerned about their self-esteem, happiness and fulfilment.  What’s interesting is that, in a number of studies like makingcaringcommon.org, “about 80 percent of youth questioned said their parents were more concerned with their achievements or happiness, than whether they cared for others.’ In addition, ‘were also three times more likely to agree that “My parents are prouder if I get good grades than if I’m a caring community member in class and school.”The Making Caring Common programme is run by Harvard psychologist, Richard Weissbourd, at the Graduate School of Education.  He says, “The challenge is not to convince parents and teachers that caring is important – they already believe it is – it’s about closing the gap between what adults say, and what they prioritise.”If you recognise yourself in there, what can you do to shift that balance?WHAT CAN I DO TO PRIORITISE CARING? At the heart of it is empathy.Your son needs to hear from you, as parent, that caring for others is a priority, and, importantly, see your words in action. You need to encourage him to balance his needs with those of others, so…sharing lunch with somebody who doesn’t have any, or standing up for a friend who’s being bullied. How do you, as parent, do it? Instead of saying : “The most important thing is that you’re happy,” rather say “The most important thing is you’re kind.”ALL EMOTIONS ARE OK, SOME REACTIONS ARE NOTSimone Taylor is an Educational Psychologist in Durban, KZN. She believes as parents, we don’t want our children to feel pain: “We unintentionally dismiss their uncomfortable emotions hoping that will help the pain go away:  ‘It’s not scary’; ‘It’s ok, don’t worry’; ‘Smile, big kids don’t cry”.” Problem is, this doesn’t remove the emotion – it teaches him to either feel it but not show it, go into denial about his feeling and say ‘I’m Fine’, or become numb to the experience, and dismiss the emotion altogether.A child may find it difficult to feel empathy for others, if they haven’t gained emotional insight into, or understanding of, how they themselves feel. When it comes to boys, this negating of emotion is often exacerbated by parenting models linked to stereotypical norms of boys needing to be strong. As Simone says, “The less tolerance and validation of emotion - “toughen up man” – the less emotional insight they’ll have, and the less likely they’ll be able to display compassion toward others.” If you haven’t been empathised with, how can you recognise and respond empathetically to others? It’s not a weakness to acknowledge the emotion present – on the contrary, it takes strength, courage and grit to acknowledge the pain and work through it. Ironically, allowing the recognition of emotion makes one stronger, not ‘softer’.”Teach your sons that all feelings are okay, but some ways of dealing with them are not helpful.“Empathy can be taught,” says Taylor. “Assist your child to learn their own emotions by acting as their mirror – put words to what you see they’re feeling. If they show sadness, mirror that with your words, thereby giving them understanding of their emotion. For example, “Ah no, you are sad because you lost your ball. It is so sad to lose something.” “Ah no, you are scared. It’s horrible to feel scared and feel like you are not safe. I am here with you. “Ah I can see you are angry. It feels so unfair you can’t watch TV and that makes you feel so cross”. Being a mirror to how your child feels allows them to gain insight into, and understanding of their emotions. That equips them to have the same for others, thus being kind, compassionate and empathetic in their interactions.”Pressure to perform in specific ways comes from numerous sources. Having empathy for others is a wonderful tool for life."

        "content": "Samantha Stewart (Galliet) looked fear dead in the eye and gave it one massive wink. 16 years ago, at age 29, she was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive strain of breast cancer (Her2) and almost didn’t receive the life-saving treatment she needed.But Sam refused to take ‘no’ for an answer and fought to get approval for the break-through therapy. Sam’s story made news headlines and her tenacity and resilience paid off, when the treatment was finally approved, not just for her but for thousands of other women facing the same fate.With all the odds stacked against her – the 7% chance of survival, the fight for her treatment and surviving an abusive marriage, she remained determined to stay alive – and live fearless.Over the last 16 years, Sam has done tremendous work in the cancer community, advocating for those who need treatment, providing a pillar of support to survivors and their families and running the first South African advocacy NGO to attend the Live Strong Summit. She also met and married the love of her life and together they offer relationship counselling.On a professional level, Sam has also designed an incredible resilience programme, including the many tools she has developed along her fearless journey. According to Sam: “If I can deal with myself successfully every day, I can deal with anything thrown at me.”The lessons she’s learned through her life have inspired her to look inward. Her ability for self-introspection and mindful awareness are fundamental to her resilience tools, which she shares with generosity and love. “I just want to help people,” Sam says, “my intention is to empower women to be fearless.”Sam was thrilled to be part of the 1st for Women Insurance fearless campaign, saying it couldn’t have come at a better time, a time in which there is a surge in divine feminine energy. Full of fun and wit, Sam is someone who says it as it is: “Thanks for being brave and having the balls to launch a campaign like this.”"

        "content": "Anele Mdoda recently announced that she has been appointed as 1st for Women’s ambassador of fearless.“Partnering with a company that is focused on spreading the message of fearlessness to South African women makes absolute sense. Being fearless doesn’t mean living a life devoid of fear, but living a life in which our fears don’t hold us back. It’s about acting despite the fear and walking with freedom, strength and hope in the face of things unknown.“South Africa is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a woman so it’s not about having nothing to fear but rather, knowing that we have the power to change our narrative from one of fear, to one of fearlessness,” explains Mdoda.For Mdoda, harnessing the power of fearless is an exercise in growth, resilience, and persistence.“The three things I do fearlessly are motherhood, my career and love. By removing the barriers to fearlessness - the fear of failure, the need to be perfect, not feeling good enough, the risk of judgement, overthinking things or feeling like I wouldn\"t be strong enough to cope if things didn’t go my way – I can embrace optimism and confidence, and power through with true intention and purpose, motivated by something that’s more important than unrealistic expectations,” says Mdoda.Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women says: “Few celebrities encapsulate the word fearless like Mdoda. She’s an icon of courage and unapologetic confidence. We are so excited to work with her to empower South African women to change their narrative from one of fear, to one of fearlessness.”“On International Women’s Day, my message to the women of South Africa is to remember that being fearless is a conscious decision – an intentional choice to overcome doubts and insecurities. Despite the chaos that surrounds us, women have an indomitable strength to take action.” "

        "content": "In the middle of the hustle and bustle of Johannesburg lies the beautiful Braamfontein Spruit. The Delta Park section, that runs from Conrad Drive in the North and Emmarentia in the South, is one of the largest and busiest public open spaces in the city. Until recently, it was also one of the most dangerous.   Prior to the establishment of Jozi Trails’ Trail Guardian community patrols in 2020, there wason averageone mugging reported in the area per week. This statistic is what inspired Jozi Trails (an NGO committed to keeping the public trails along the Spruit safe, attractive and accessible) to call for volunteers to join their Trail Guardian project to tackle the problem of crime in Delta Park. Established in 2017 by a group of passionate trail users, Jozi Trails works on behalf of the Metro to develop and maintain all the trails along the Braamfontein Spruit. This includes those in Delta Park.   Jozi Trails recruited other like-minded and concerned community members to join their initiative as Trail Guardians. “These dedicated individuals volunteer their time to observe park-users and if needed, report suspicious activity to the local security authorities. Their visibility had a massive and almost immediate impact, with crime in the park reducing to almost zero,” says David Kramer, Manager of Jozi Trails.   South Africa’s only insurer dedicated to putting women’s safety first, 1st for Women Insurance, recently partnered with Jozi Trails to enhance its safety initiatives and encourage more people to experience the beautiful Braamfontein Spruit.  “The Trail Guardians are an extension of our Guardian Angel on Call fleet of pink Toyota Urban Cruisers which are on call, 24/7, to protect and guard female motorists following a breakdown or car accident. We know that when women feel safe, they can live more fearlessly.  When sunsets are not curfews, they’ll be able to do more, be more and achieve more,” says Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women.   “We are thrilled to partner with a company whose core values align so closely to ours,” says Kramer. “With the support of 1st for Women, we will be able to expand our efforts beyond Delta Park and increase our security along the current trails.”  "

        "content": "We know how much you love the fur members of your family – and how fearlessly you protect them. With the holiday season around the corner, we thought it was the ideal time to talk pet safety, whether you’re planning a trip with your pet or spending the holidays with them at home. Here goes… Take the fear out of fireworks Unfortunately, despite the laws against the use of fireworks, many people still use them to celebrate over the festive season. Thankfully there are many remedies that can help ease the stress on both you and your pet. Below are just a few examples: · Give your pets calming medication, from early in the day, so it has time to work. Consult your vet about the best remedy and dosage for your pet.· Make sure they get plenty of exercise during the day so they don’t have pent up energy at night, which can leave them in a state of frenzy.· Ensure that all doors and windows are securely closed and locked, and that they don’t have access to gates or burglar bars they can try to squeeze through.· Create a calm environment in the house, close curtains, dim the lights and play soothing music. Keep them in a room where they are comfortable and where you can easily identify and address safety hazards.· If your pet is happy in a crate, that’s even better, as it’s a small, familiar and a safe space where they can feel most protected.· Keep them distracted. Chewing is soothing for dogs so leave them with their favourite chew toy, a peanut butter-filled Kong, or other interactive toys. Avoid dangerous decorations A beautifully decorated Christmas tree is lovely to look at, but it can also be a safety hazard for pets. Here are some things to consider before you start hauling out the lights and tinsel: · Ensure your tree is properly secured. Cats climbing trees and dogs pulling at branches can send the whole thing crashing down on them.· Christmas ornaments may look like delightful chew toys to your pets. Avoid placing fragile or glass ornaments low down on the tree where they can easily grab hold of them.· Avoid tinsel and beaded strings low down on the tree. These are dangerous digestive hazards.· Christmas lights can short out, overheat or even electrocute your pet. So, ensure that you turn off lights when you are not in the room.· Don’t leave presents out overnight. Curious pets can not only tear up packaging and destroy what’s inside, but they can also hurt themselves in the process, especially if they swallow small objects. Beat the fierce summer heat We’re in the height of summer at Christmas time, just as we need sunscreen, shade and plenty of fluids, so do our furry friends. Below are some helpful tips for keeping them cool: · Ensure that there is always an ample supply of cool, fresh water at various locations in your home or your holiday accommodation.· Make sure that pets have access to plenty of shady spots in the garden.· Try keep them in grassy areas or paved areas which are always shaded.· Have plenty of indoor activities to keep them busy.· Look out for signs of heatstroke, which include heavy panting and excessive drooling. Immediately contact your vet for the best treatment. And there you have it, a comprehensive guide to pet safety this festive season. Now all that’s left to do is sit back, relax and enjoy a well-deserved break."

        "description": "",
        "content": "The 1st for Women Foundation was established with the purpose of uplifting, empowering and inspiring the women of South Africa. Because the 1st for Women customers donate a portion of their monthly insurance premiums to the Foundation, we wanted them to guide its focus. The two main causes selected were gender-based violence and cervical cancer, and these causes thus became the primary focus area for the Foundation.To date, the Foundation is proud to have donated over R46 million towards its gender-based violence and cervical cancer initiatives. As part of the 67 minutes initiative this year, the Foundation will continue its sponsorship of #B4MD2016 (Bikers for Mandela Day 2016) with the goal of sustaining the humanitarian legacy of Madiba by supporting a number of organisations for 67 minutes per organisation.The 1st for Women Foundation aims to contribute to the prevention of gender-based violence, and support survivors at the same time. In the past year alone 98 000 people have benefitted from the Foundation’s support across its three focus areas of community based prevention of gender-based violence; strengthening of services within the criminal justice system; and supporting organisations providing services to survivors of gender-based violence (care and support).On Thursday July 14th 2016, the team will head to Bethany Home for Abused Women and their Children, a rehabilitation centre, to inspire the community, motivate the women at the home to take charge of their destinies and change their circumstances for the better. This year the Foundation will be donating R50 000 to the home. The team will also be painting the jungle gyms, restringing the washing lines as well as cleaning up the garden beds at the home.The 1st for Women Foundation team along with the Bikers for Mandela Day will then make their way to the Barberton Police Station in Nelspruit on Friday the 15th of July. There, together with GRIP (Greater Rape Intervention Project) they will refurbish an area used for their victim empowerment programme.  This area is used to support victims of GBV, and is currently in a dire state and needs to be restored urgently. The refurbishment will transform the area into a safe, secure and comfortable haven for the victims and survivors of GBV.On Sunday the 17th of July, the bikers and the Foundation team will head back to Nelspruit to plant a vegetable garden and do general repair work at a safe house for survivors of abuse.  There, a donation of R50 000 will be made to GRIP to help support and assist survivors of sexual violence and raise awareness of sexual offences within the more prominent Nelspruit area in Mpumalanga. The Foundation hopes that this project will inspire confidence in the women and children of Nelspruit to put themselves first, the confidence to walk away from an abusive relationship, the confidence to remind themselves about all that they have achieved and the confidence to love and take care of themselves.In a country known as the rape capital of the world, gender-based violence is a shocking reality for so many South African women. The Bethany Home and GRIP projects are just two examples of how dedicated the 1st for Women Foundation is to the prevention of this injustice to the women of our country. Follow our journey as we keep inspiring confidence and making a tangible and sustainable difference to the lives of thousands of South African women."

        "content": "Creativity in any form can move you. Whether it’s a portrait of an ancestor hanging on a living room wall, a song on the radio, a child’s first finger painting, or a character in a movie or a book, art can reach parts of you that you never knew existed. Most of the time, when you’re touched by something, it’s because you see yourself in that thing; there is some quality that is relatable in some way. Because that feeling of finding something in art that speaks directly to you is so fulfilling, we thought we’d look at some of modern culture’s female animated characters and superheroes that simply kick butt, and see how their deeds can inspire women in everyday situations. Mulan  Mulan is one of the ultimate tales of bravery in modern culture. It tells the story of a young Chinese girl who disguises herself as a man so that she can take her father’s place in the army to save his life; her father is old and wounded and she knows that if he fights, he will likely not live. While this might not be a situation that every woman finds herself in, you’ve likely been in a position that required you to make a sacrifice for a loved one, even though it might not have been in your own best interests. We know that, as a woman, you do so much for those around you, but that’s not to say that you shouldn’t have someone looking out for you as well. Just as Mulan had the little dragon Mushu to watch out for her, we watch out for you. That’s why we offer a range of tailor-made insurance products, like our Public Liability Insurance for businesswomen or our Off-road Vehicle Cover for the adventurous spirit. Bumblebee What we love the most about Karen Beecher, also known as the superhero Bumblebee, is that her super-smart wits are her superpower. She majored in political science, physics and computer technology, and has created her own high-tech suit that gives her all of her powers. She is relatable to girls and women in how she uses her skills to do the right thing, which is one of the most courageous acts a person can do. So the next time you need a little courage to stand up for what you believe in, remember that doing that is its own kind of superpower. Frozen  If you’ve got young daughters, teenage nieces, elderly mothers, or actually if you just own a TV, it’s likely you know all the words to Let It Go! A relationship with a sister is unlike any other. From when you’re little, it’s filled with nights of giggling together with the lights off, screaming matches, intense make-up hugs, notes or SMSs to each other in class, mid-week coffee catch-ups, and midnight selfies. That’s what we love about the sisters from Frozen, Elsa and Anna. The movie has smashed records for many reasons, one of which might be how great it is to see women having the courage to just be themselves. Elsa has a superpower that has the potential to hurt others, but rather than suppressing the greatness within her, she embraces it. If you’ve ever downplayed your own abilities, you’ll know how inhibiting it can be. But when you let it go and let your capabilities speak for themselves, the results are always awesome. We also love seeing our own sisterly relationships reflected in the movie, and even if you don’t have a sister, you’ll know what that beautiful bond feels like with a best friend. Merida  Merida is the lively character from the animated movie Brave, which is aptly named as she pulls courage from deep within her and defies tradition to forge her own path in life. She has the guts to simply be herself and follow her own dreams, which we can all relate to at some point in our lives. Whenever you do something for yourself that defies how others see you or perceive how you should be, we think you deserve a round of applause, no matter how big or small that act of boldness may be. At 1st for Women, we believe that all women have inherent greatness in them and that what they do each day makes them everyday superheroes. We know that being yourself and managing your own journey in your own way make you a courageous woman. And because of that, you deserve insurance products and benefits that amplify your potential. That’s why, when you get Car, Home, or Business Insurance quotes from us, we take your individual needs into account and give you cover that really takes care of you."

        "description": "",
        "content": "‘More time!’ is the rallying call of women everywhere; balancing the demands of work and home life while still reaching to insert the interests they have and the causes they care about into their busy schedules.In modern times, that eye-rolling adage of ‘women’s place’ can be defined as ‘everywhere’.  And as most South African women gracefully walk this high wire, we often wonder how they do it all so deftly.One such amazing woman is Thakgalo Mashabela; one part of the dynamic threesome behind the well-loved blog A Well Heeled Woman. As most women today consistently juggle several important things at once, we talk to Thakgalo about how she’s mastered this juggling act with such extraordinary ease.The fine art of planning“Plan ahead,” says Thakgalo. “It’s the only way I manage; I stick to my schedule and run everything in accordance to my plan. It’s much like the old saying ‘if you fail to plan, you’re planning to fail. For that reason, everything comes with a plan’.”When asked what advice she’d give other women striving to find balance Thakgalo says, “The first thing we need to do is accept that it isn’t easy to do it all. But we have to focus and find time for ourselves. In that time, we can set our priorities and decide what we need to manage first and get that out of the way before tackling the smaller things. And in setting priorities, we have to stay in tune with ourselves: know what matters most.”Women make it work!But even Thakgalo agrees that that’s a tall ask. According to her, however, we have the inherent ability to make it work. “Women are strong and adaptable. When faced with a change in circumstances we might panic at first, but if we focus we’ll quickly solve it. In my experience, women manage change very well as soon as they realise that they are bigger than the situation they face.”In a nutshell, then, it boils down to the realisation that modern women juggle a lot of responsibility from careers, to family, to interests to causes – and our ability as women to easily adapt to change, plan ahead and make it work.“And that’s the very insight this company was founded on,” says Marketing Manager of 1st for Women, Casey Rosseau. “Knowing that women have their own needs and interests and making sure that we provide fair cover for them based on who they are. It’s a service offering that’s as unique as it is necessary.”"

        "description": "",
        "content": "Nelson Mandela said, \"I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.\" Courage means something different to everyone. For some, it’s the big, brave acts that we see superheroes in the movies perform. For others, it’s the quiet, humble deed of standing up for something you know is right. Still for other people, it’s having the bravery to be yourself, whatever that means to you. Courage is all of these things, and what meaning it holds for you will depend on the day, your mood, and the situation you find yourself in. 1st for Women thinks that all women show their own kind of courage each day, whether it’s caring for a sick child, calling a friend whom you’ve had an argument with, or keeping a date when you’ve had a rough day. It can even be working through some admin tasks when you’re feeling dejected, like getting building insurance quotes. The next time you find yourself needing a little courage, it might help to remember that there are a bunch of emotional and physical benefits that come with being brave. Here are some of our favourites: You make more connections Have you ever met someone and thought, “I love how that person is always just herself”? Being comfortable with yourself puts others at ease around you. And whether that means you like to say what’s on your mind, or you’re totally content to be an introvert or an extrovert, it’s appealing when you are who you are. You learn  The results of a 2013 study suggest that the more stimulating and challenging a task is, the better it is for your mental health. When you step outside of your comfort zone and take on something that is different, you exercise your brain more. And what’s even more interesting is that, when you do something out of the ordinary with your loved ones, it’s even better for you, so you can deepen your social bonds and build relationships while keeping your mind fit. You grow  OK, so you’ve always wanted to sky dive. Or maybe you want to join the local netball team. Maybe you just want an evening to let yourself relax, whether that means reading a book or watching your favourite show. Being brave can involve doing something you’ve been putting off, no matter how big or small it may seem to others. Stepping outside of the security of familiarity is challenging, which is exactly why you should do it from time to time. When you challenge yourself in this way, you’ll find resources within you that you probably never knew you had. Encourage yourself Think back to the last time you did something that was really difficult; you were scared, but you did it anyway. That feeling you had was probably a mixture of pride and resilience, and didn’t it make you feel really great? The more you exercise your courage muscle, the more you build it. If you trust yourself and do something that you’re scared to do, you’ll be building up your confidence. Remember, going beyond what you’re normally comfortable with doesn’t necessarily mean actively going out and partaking in heart-racing activities; it can be as simple as recognising that you offer so much value to the world around you and making a pact with yourself to simply be who you are. At 1st for Women, we know that, as a woman, you have inherent greatness in you and we want to help you let that greatness shine. That’s why we offer tailor-made insurance products that are designed to help you be the best version of yourself, whether it’s in our Vehicle, Home, or Building Insurance. "

        "content": "This time of the year is always hectic; we rush to get all of our work done in time, we triple check that our holiday arrangements are finalised, we worry about if our children are going to do well in their final exams, and we still need to stay on top of all those little admin tasks, like paying the levies or getting affordable life insurance quotes before we can take that well-deserved break. This is why we support our clients in as many ways as we can; we take care of the little things for them, like their life cover, so that they can be at their best each day without having to worry. Just to give you a little extra support for these last weeks of the year, we thought we’d share encouraging stories of women from around the globe who are doing their best and making a difference; we’re looking at some of the world’s most inspiring women of 2015 and we are celebrating their achievements. We hope they inspire you as much as they’ve inspired us! Adv. Thulisile (Thuli) Nomkhosi Madonsela  Before we look around the globe, let’s admire a woman from our own beautiful country. Thuli Madonsela is a pillar of ethics to not just South Africans, but the rest of the world, too. She was one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People in 2014, but we think she still deserves to be recognised for her continued role as South Africa’s public protector in 2015. Thuli is also a human rights activist and her office has continued to ceaselessly investigate governmental corruption this year. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna  These women may not have glamorous occupations in the traditional sense of the word, but their work in 2015 has far-reaching implications for generations to come. Both are geneticists and have developed a new technique of gene modifying that could help fight innumerable diseases such as HIV and even some types of cancer. The implications of their discovery are only beginning to be understood, but we know that it will change how scientists and medical professionals fight disease. Malala Yousafzai  This marks the third year running where Malala Yousafzai has been included in Time’s ‘100 Most Influential People’ list. Malala ceaselessly campaigns for the rights of girls globally to receive an education, and is leading the way with excellent marks at the Edgbaston High School in Birmingham. A year ago, on 10 December 2014, Malala accepted the Nobel Peace Prize and donated $1.1 million in prize money to the financing of a secondary school for girls in Pakistan. On her 18th birthday this year, she opened the Malala Yousafzai All-girls School, which provides secondary education to Syrian girls living in informal camps near the Syrian border in Lebanon. Malala’s continued courage in the face of life-threatening challenges to stand up for young girls’ rights inspires us to do and be better. Eniola Aluko  Eniola has one of the most recognisable faces in women’s football. She is a striker in the England and Chelsea squads, won the Player-of-the-Match Award in this year’s FA Women’s Cup Final, and to top it all off, she is also a lawyer! This multi-talented Lagos-born footballer is also known for championing better pay for England’s women football players and has been vocal about racism in the men’s game. Syeda Ghulam Fatima  Before 15 August 2015, the majority of the world had never heard of Syeda Ghulam Fatima, but by 19 August, people from all over the globe had donated over $2.2 million to her cause. The popular photoblogging series Humans of New York spotlighted Fatima’s strength, bravery and resilience when it presented a series on the plight of brick kiln workers in Pakistan while doing an overseas series for the blog earlier this year. Bricks make up 3% of Pakistan’s GDP. Brick kiln owners are so wealthy that despite bonded labour being illegal, they are able to force more than a million people into modern-day slavery within their businesses. According to HONY, Fatima has undergone severe physical violence and intimidation for most of her life to end bonded labour in Pakistan, but has not been deterred in her fight to help the victims of brick kiln owners. Fatima’s courage in the face of death and intimidation is awe-inspiring. Meryl Streep She may not seem like an obvious choice at first, but Meryl Streep’s generous philanthropic work has continued for 30 years. Together with her husband, she established a charity called Silver Mountain Foundation for the Arts in the early ’80s, which has donated millions of dollars to all areas of the Arts, including theatre, music, and film. She has also supported charities that focus on bringing amazing women to the fore, like the Vital Voices Global Partnership, who define their mission as “to invest in women leaders who improve the world.” She also supports the Women’s Refugee Commission and Women for Women International. Meryl has quietly continued her philanthropic work this year as she always has, which makes her one of our Women of 2015. At 1st for Women, we think all of our clients are inspiring in their own ways, which is why we offer car, home, and life cover that is tailor-made just for them. We believe in all things our clients do, whether big or small, and support them in whatever roles they take on each day. Life products are underwritten by 1Life, an authorised financial services provider."

        "content": "In Women’s Month, South Africa commemorates the actions of the women who, on 9 August 1956, marched on the Union Buildings to protest the pass laws of the apartheid government. Every year, we celebrate those everyday women, who, through their convictions and their actions became heroes. While there are many battles for equality, freedom and justice still to be won, we often forget the many ways in which all women are heroes every day.This blog is dedicated to all the heroes who walk among us, every day. Here are some of the reasons we believe that you’re incredible.You start each day meaning to do better!  Every day, you start the day with a plan – a plan for doing the things you have to do and helping the people you want to help . This optimism and determination to improve things around you are part of what makes you who you are, so we acknowledge that starting each day with the right foot forward is hard work made manifest.You consider others Whether you have children, a partner, family members, colleagues, friends or employees, we know that you give them a lot of thought. You are aware of how your actions affect them, and you try to do what’s best for everyone, not just yourself. While it’s important to acknowledge that you can’t always keep everyone happy, we’ve seen how hard you try.You make a huge contribution to your family, our economy and the future If you have a job or take care of your family’s needs, you are making a contribution to our country’s economy and its future. Your willingness to support others, to prepare children for the life ahead or to earn a living keeps everything ticking over. For the contribution that you make with such commitment – in all areas of life – we recognise your efforts.You care about your community and the world  You take your empty wine bottles to the recycling depot, you try to buy fair trade coffee and organic bananas, and you make sure that you hang on to your last R5 so that you can give it to the guy who watched your car. These random acts of charity and eco-awareness all contribute to making the world a better place – one action at a time. It’s great that you care.You think about the sisterhood of women Whether or not you identify as a feminist, you care deeply about women’s rights and equality. No matter what your choices as an individual, you recognise that other women are entitled to their choices and self-expression too. This belief in the freedom to be a woman, enjoyed in a country where it is enshrined in the constitution, is a powerful thing, and you’re probably not even aware of the ways in which you express it, every day.You give love Every woman loves someone – you love selflessly and with care and consideration. There are people whose needs you would put before your own, and those people’s lives are enriched by your love. Never stop giving so selflessly and openly. You are our hero.You are a hero to yourself Of course, with all the work that you put in to helping others, remember that you are your own hero too. When you take the time to heal, replenish or revitalise – in a stolen ten-minute coffee break or over a let-it-all-out dinner with your best friends – you are looking after yourself so that you can continue looking after others. Don’t ever give up on you!Happy Women’s Month Women of South Africa, we see all the wonderful things you do, every day, to make other’s lives better, easier, less complicated and happier. You’re all heroes to us. We salute you! "

        "content": "By now you know that 1st for Women is inspired by the beautiful women of South Africa. And yes, that means you, too. You may have read up on Niamaat &amp; Nur-Jehan as well as Megan &amp; Alta from our television commercial . Now it’s time for couple number three! This is the story behind the story of Frieda and Mbali. Frieda takes flying high to a whole new level. As a professional flight attendant, she’s dedicated her life to making people feel safe and comfortable both up in the air and back at home. Mbali, her daughter, is dynamite in a small package. She has a smile that brightens the room and the kind of smarts that had her representing South Africa on an academic trip to America some years back.Together, they’ve taken on the world! And, while it’s hard for them to be worlds apart at times, nothing can come between the connection they have with each other. They’re strong, they’re bold and their inner beauty bursts through in everything they do. Even when life gets a little tough, they push each other forward with a see-saw-like strength that just seems to work so well! “She’s always there for me when I need her. She even gives me advice when I’m down! That’s it. That’s my Mbali for you. My beautiful flower. ”  - Frieda “I don’t think I’d be where I am today without her. Even though I don’t always believe in myself, she does, so it’s okay.”  - Mbali To us, it’s clear that their shared compassion has helped shaped the women they’ve both become. What’s a little less clear is why they find it so hard to take the credit for it. 1st for Women encourages all women to stop, take a moment, and acknowledge the significance of their contributions and the immense value that they have added throughout their lives. Their contagious energy and confidence inspire us to do what we do for the women of South Africa. That’s why we put Frieda, Mbali, and others just like them, first with tailor-made insurance products and the added benefits they deserve."

If you haven’t seen our brand new television commercial, You’ve heard Niamaat and Nur-Jehan’s story and now it’s time to get to know our second couple a little better. This is the story behind the story of Megan and Alta. Alta is as selfless as it gets. It’s ingrained in her nature to give, love and nurture the people lucky enough to find their way into her life – one of them being the beautifully bubbly Megan. Their inspiring story is one that started in turmoil, grew through courage, and flourished into a triumphant tale with a happy ending. Alta – although not Megan’s biological mother – fought for a little girl from rocky beginnings and, in baby steps, she built her back up and raised her as her own. Megan’s brand new life even came with her very own nickname, too. Pragtige Blommetjie. And aptly so! Since then, Megan has become a top-notch scholar and Alta has been behind her all the way with a little tough love, some sweet soentjies and a few tango moves here and there for fun. “She made me feel young again. She had to overcome a lot. I tried my best to give her my strength and she just gives it right back to me.” - Alta “She said she saw a light in me and she took it upon herself to make that light shine brighter. From the moment she took me in, she changed everything. She gave me my life back.” - Megan And, not only do they pass on the strength that got them both through it all, but they continuously pass the credit on to one another, too. 1st for Women would like all women to acknowledge their inner strength, resolve, and power, as well as the impact and value that they have added throughout their lives. They’re beautiful, inside and out, and they inspire us to do what we do for the women of South Africa. That’s why we put Megan, Alta, and others just like them, first with tailor-made insurance products and the added benefits they deserve."

This is the story behind the story of Zia and Lizette.Lizette is a woman who can take just about any tough situation and turn it around. She’s a mother who stops to appreciate the little things and inspires those around her to do the same.And when her daughter, Zia, was diagnosed with diabetes at a very young age, Lizette didn’t let it get in the way of her little one’s life. In fact, she decided to master the greatest sugar-free chocolate cake recipe for Zia and her schoolmates to celebrate life the way every child deserves to.Zia, now also a mother, has achieved more than even her doctors had expected from her – the kind of beautiful soul that was able to find happiness within the boundaries laid out for her.They’re a powerful duo that proves the right support means everything.“When things got tough, Zia did what she needed to do and that made her who she is. She found freedom within the framework of limits.” - Lizette“What my mom did made me who I am today. She gave me the freedom to figure it out my way. Now, I can be a good mom because I had the greatest example.” - ZiaThey held each other up and kept each other going when the odds were against them. Yet, after all they’ve done for one another, neither of them will take much credit. 1st for Women would like all women to recognise what an amazing job they’re doing as well as the impact and value that they have added throughout their lives.Their perseverance, positivity and strength inspire us to do what we do for the women of South Africa.

        "content": "At 1st for Women, we are inspired by the women we insure – their lives and the impact they have on the lives of others. The launch of our brand new television commercial explores the stories of four inspirational women and their equally incredible daughters. Haven’t seen it yet? Where have you been!? Grab a tissue or two and take a look for yourself.We’d like to let you in on the story behind the story.It’s time for you to get to know Niamaat and Nur-Jehan.Niamaat is most certainly a force to be reckoned with – a strong, powerful career woman and loving mother of three. She manages to do it all and then some, balancing her impressive career with the ups and downs of family life.And, as the first woman in her family to go to university, she’s the embodiment of ‘girl power’.Even whilst juggling three jobs, and yet ANOTHER degree to add to her list of many, she still made time to raise her youngest daughter, Nur-Jehan, who’s no doubt following in her mother’s footsteps.Not only did Nur-Jehan graduate top of her class, but she’s already well on her way to success. Watch this space. She’s heading straight for greatness and we’ll be right behind her.In fact, the only thing more impressive than their combined achievements, is the unbreakable bond they share – one of unconditional love and the kind of selfless pride that keeps both of them moving steadily towards big things:‘Nur-Jehan sets trends; not follows them. And if there’s a hurdle, she’ll jump it 10x higher. It’s funny. She’s 10x more confident than I ever was. Or am.’  – Niamaat‘My mother’s perseverance, determination, and confidence inspires me. Seeing her overcome her struggles shows me that I can be anything I want.’  – Nur-JehanBoth of these women are amazing in their own right, yet continuously pass the credit on to one another for it. 1st for Women would like all women to stop, take a moment, and acknowledge the significance of their contributions as well as the impact and value that they have added throughout their lives.This power mother-daughter-best-friend duo inspires us to do what we do for the women of South Africa.

        "content": "\"There is 1 universal truth applicable to all countries, cultures &amp; communities: violence against women is never acceptable, never excusable, and never tolerable.\" - Ban Ki-moon.Many women have experienced abuse in one form or another. The number of cases is far too high for us to turn a blind eye with each year that passes. As a brand that believes in inspiring confidence, we find this to be unacceptable as no women should have their confidence diminished, preventing them from being the best version of themselves.That is why the 1st for Women Foundation was established - to uplift and inspire the victims of women abuse, because it is a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination. To date, the Foundation has donated over R49 million to a number of charities that focus on assisting victims and survivors of abuse through a portion of our clients’ monthly contributions.One case of women abuse is one too many, that is why this year, 1st for Women has teamed up with Jacaranda FM and East Coast Radio to bring you the annual 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters protest walk. On 20 November, 1st for Women will be partnering with East Coast Radio to bring the very first 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters protest walk in Durban at the Chris Saunders park in Umhlanga. On 26 November, thousands of walkers will unite at Montecasino in Fourways where the 11th annual 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters protest walk with Jacaranda FM will take place.Don’t miss out on a fun-filled day with your friends, family and furry pups! As we like saying at 1st for Women, when we come together with a common goal in mind, so many amazing things can be achieved. This is your chance to dress up in your brightest outfit, step out in your funkiest heels, speak out and inspire victims and survivors of women abuse to change their lives for the better. Remember that all proceeds raised from this event will be donated to two charities. The first is The Centre for Community Justice and Development (CCJD), which is a non-profit organisation that provides fundraising, training, research and other support services to fifteen community-based advice offices in KwaZulu-Natal. The second is Women and Men Against Child Abuse (WMACA), an organisation committed to fighting for the rights of the child and to end the abuse of children in South Africa, by striving to form a multi-faceted, dynamic and aggressive offensive against any form of abuse.On both days, we will have some great performances to keep you entertained. TIMO ODV will put on a great show for the Durban walkers, and Louise Carver will keep the crowd on their feet in Johannesburg. Also available on both days will be massage booths to say thank you for walking with 1st for Women in the fight to eradicate violence against women in our country. To capture the memories of the day, we will have a photo and video booth where you can share your messages of support and encouragement for victims and survivors of abuse. You never know how many lives your words might touch, so don’t miss this opportunity to possibly help someone rise above their circumstances.Remember that you still have time to register for the protest walk for both days. Simply visit this link and register today! Bring as many friends and family members as you can, because the more walkers we have, the more united we stand in saying NO! to violence against our mother, sisters, wives, grandmothers, daughters, nieces, girlfriends, aunts, co-workers and friends.If you can’t make it to this year’s protest walk, you can still make a difference by donating your social voice to this worthy cause. Simply click here and donate your voice to women who are struggling to speak for themselves. At 1st for Women, we believe that when we speak out together, we’re louder and much more powerful. That’s why we’re using the power of the collective to ROAR for the cause to help raise money for victims and survivors of women abuse. There IS strength in numbers, and with that strength comes power – the power to make a difference."

        "content": "According to the Harvard Business Review, women now drive the world economy. Over the years, women’s roles and responsibilities have constantly evolved and globally, women now earn approximately $20 trillion each year and control just over $25 trillion in annual spending. Women are often the chief purchasing officers and decision makers in their households. They make the decision on the purchases of 94% of home furnishing, 92% of vacations, 91% of homes, 60% of cars, and 51% of consumer electronics.Not only that but more women are choosing careers in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.  More women now also hold key senior management positions in large corporations, and various studies have shown that increasing women and girls’ education has contributed to about 50% of the economic growth in OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries over the past 50 years. All over the world, women play a vital role in supporting their households and communities in achieving food and nutrition security, generating income, and improving rural livelihoods and overall well-being.Women are doing more things now than ever before and in celebration of International Women’s Day on 8 March, we celebrate all women for who they are and what they have done for the women in society as well as for the ladies who are nearest and dearest to them. And while there is a continued, necessary movement to a more inclusive, gender-equal world, we take this time to acknowledge what has already been done by the women of the past and the women of today.Currently a member and co-chair of the International Women\"s Media Foundation (IWMF) as well as the anchor of BBC World News America, Katty Kay is a prominent figure in the fight for gender equality in the workforce in America. Through the foundation, Katty offers support, guidance and encouragement by strengthening the role of women journalists worldwide. The IWMF also celebrates the courage of women journalists worldwide, who overcome threats and oppression to speak out on global issues, and fully supports, protects, recognises and rewards them for their vital contributions at all levels of the news media.Looking at South Africa, Wendy Luhabe is one of the most powerful and visionary businesswoman in the fight for gender equality in the country. She broke new ground in 1994 by founding a women’s investment group Wiphold, which enabled tens of thousands of women to invest for the first time and was the first women-owned company to list on the JSE. She then started a private but successful equity fund for women-owned businesses. She is also the author of Defining Moments, the profits of which go to a fund for women. At 1st for Women, our role is to inspire confidence in women to help them realise their inherent strength, resolve and power so that they are able to be their best selves unapologetically, and we do this by ensuring they are on the front foot in any situation knowing that we are here to support them every step of the way through our tailor-made insurance offerings.To support South African women who have been diagnosed with a dread disease, 1st for Women has created All Woman Dread Disease Cover. This offering offers financial support against female- and children-specific cancers, systemic lupus, and pregnancy-related complications and more, so should the unthinkable happen, you and your family are taken care of.We also know that for many women, a handbag is more than just something they carry their belongings in. It holds their entire world inside it, that’s why we’ve included Handbag Cover to the value of R5000 in our Home Contents Insurance. This ensures that your precious belongings can be replaced in case of theft, damage or loss so that you can keep doing what you do best.To find out more about Handbag Cover and All Woman Dread Disease Cover, call us on 0861 91 77 73 or visit our website today.Sources:https://hbr.org/2009/09/the-female-economy"

        "content": "So what is it that makes SA so amazing? Simple – it’s our very own inspiring women. Whether they’re making waves in the political sector, making a difference with their philanthropy or making sure we’re always informed, you’ll want to know more about what drives these incredible women. Prepare to be inspired!Ferial Haffajee  Considered one of the most respected and influential women in the South African media, Ferial Haffajee has been keeping us in the know for more than three decades. She began her career as a reporter at the Mail &amp; Guardian and, in 2004, she was appointed as its editor. Impressively, she was SA’s first woman to edit a national mainstream newspaper – and in 2009, she took her place at the helm of City Press. During her tenure, Haffajee has also worked as a radio producer, TV reporter, and political editor at the Financial Mail. And just last year Ferial Haffajee was voted one of New African’s 100 Most Influential Africans.Thuli Madonsela  There are few people who can claim to be as formidable as our former public protector Thuli Madonsela! As a human rights lawyer, she’s been involved in community and social justice issues since the 1980s. And, with her expertise and knowledge on equality and policy, she was ideally placed to be a part of the team that drafted the country’s constitution in 1996. And Thuli is definitely not afraid of taking a stand, the very reason why the Press Club named her Newsmaker of the Year in 2016.Jane Raphaely When we think of SA’s most popular magazines, one name will always come to mind: Jane Raphael. She’s the woman who launched Fairlady, COSMOPOLITAN and later Femina – and went on to form one of the most successful publishing companies in the country, Associated Magazines. Since then Jane has been the recipient of many awards for both her professional and humanitarian achievements and she’s still doing what she does best today! "

        "content": "There are angels who walk among us. They do not possess wings or halos, but their selflessness and courage is a beacon of light for those who have no one to turn to. Today, we celebrate these everyday angels – who do so much for so many and seldom take credit.Since 2005, 1st for Women has worked with a choir of angels dedicated to making a difference to the lives of victims and survivors of women abuse.  These women work tirelessly to help those affected by abuse gain control of their lives once again.One such organisation is Lawyers Against Abuse (LvA), a non-profit organisation that provides psychosocial support for victims of women abuse.For women who lack the resources to pursue legal remedy for women abuse, LvA provides essential advice, not only from a legal standpoint, but for emotional support too. LvA’s approach is to address the mental and emotional trauma of these experiences in addition to guiding victims through the legal process.Through its integrated support, LvA also aims to drive awareness of women’s rights in underprivileged communities and encourage victims to report crimes without fear of being victimised or questioned when they do.Lindsay Henson is the Executive Director of LvA. Before joining LvA in September 2014, Lindsay worked with NGOs in India, Bangladesh and the Philippines addressing women abuse and other human rights issues. She also has experience working with victims of domestic and sexual violence. According to Lindsay, “This job never gets easier but I feel privileged to play a small part in the process of seeking justice and healing of women and children. It’s incredible for me to stand with victims as they stand up to their abusers. To hear the laughter of survivors in our centre is powerful. So often, women walk through this process alone. It’s incredibly meaningful to play even just a small part in their process.”Noluthando Moyana is LvA’s therapist and psychosocial programme coordinator. She joined LvA in March 2017 and has over 10 years of experience working with victims of women abuse in communities. Her passion is to empower women who are otherwise disempowered. “Educating women, giving them access to counselling and encouraging self-care – that’s what keeps me going. As much as the job is very hard, it gives me emotional satisfaction to know I’m making a difference,” explains Moyana.Rethabile Mosese joined LvA in July 2015.  She is an admitted attorney of the High Court of South Africa in Gauteng and is particularly interested in human rights and constitutional law. “For me it’s about unlearning certain behaviours and beliefs and knowing that I can make a difference,” says Mosese.So far, contributions from the 1st for Women Foundation to LvA have directly impacted up to 500 victims of women abuse. Victims who might otherwise never seek the protection that allows them to gain control of their lives once again – and often, the lives of their children.The 1st for Women Foundation empowers passionate women to fulfil their roles as everyday angels for the women around them. We’re celebrating these heroes by calling on women to recognise other #EverydayAngels in their own community and give them the support they deserve.

        "content": "“We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back.” – Malala YousafzaiThe World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Gender Gap report reveals that it would take over 200 years to achieve gender equality, so it isn’t seemingly something we’ll see in our lifetimes, if things continue as they are. That’s why the theme this year is to #PressforProgress, to hasten progress so we have the chance to see gender equality come to life.Broadly speaking, International Women’s Day is about celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women and whilst there have been a myriad of successes for women, both big and small, to achieve gender equality, the obstacles we face need to be addressed at a greater rate!The idea that gender equality and women abuse are inextricably linked is well documented – economically disadvantaged women are more susceptible to women abuse, and cultural and social norms play a big role in determining how women are treated on an individual level, whether in relationships, education, or their professional lives.South Africa has one of the highest gender-based violence rates in the world. But we know that, when women are uplifted and empowered, their families, communities and countries benefit. Based on a report conducted in 2014, women abuse costs South Africa anywhere between R28.4 billion and R42.4 billion per year, so not only is this a moral issue for our country, it’s also one that is hurting our economy.This is where 1st for Women works to make a difference – because we are for women. Our world is women and we exist to add value to their lives, which we do by providing products and benefits that help to keep them safe and make their lives easier.What is 1st for Women doing for gender equality?“No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens.” – Michelle ObamaThe 1st for Women Foundation We established the 1st for Women Foundation in 2005 and it has since raised over R56 million. Its aim is to make a real difference in women’s lives. One of its main focus areas is supporting organisations fighting women abuse.ForWomenWe recently launched ForWomen, a platform that consolidates women abuse fighting efforts in one place. The platform is structured to holistically address this epidemic through three pillars – prevention, preparation and provision.Prevention: ForWomen addresses the causes of women abuse.Preparation: ForWomen equips women to respond to abuse.Provision: ForWomen provides support for women who are in or have left abusive relationships.ForWomen will help us #PressforProgress as any person, regardless of socioeconomic status, can get help, and companies and individuals who have the power to make a meaningful impact, big or small, can give help.Sisters with BlistersThis year, our annual Sisters with Blisters protest walk is happening in Durban and Johannesburg. The money raised from these walks will be donated to the following organisations, which are committed to making a positive difference in the lives of abused women and children.The Centre for Community Justice and Development (CCJD) – supports community-based offices in KwaZulu-Natal, where people in rural communities can get legal advice and counselling for domestic violence and child abuse.Lawyers against Abuse – provides free legal and psychosocial support services to victims of sexual and domestic violence, and child abuse.Women and Men against Child Abuse – committed to ending child abuse in South Africa, this organisation works to break the silence on sexual abuse of children and effect positive change in communities.How can you join the fight against women abuse? \"The story of women\"s struggle for equality belongs to no single feminist nor to any one organisation, but to the collective efforts of all who care about human rights.” – Gloria SteinemVisit ForWomen, sign the pledge and give help or get help in the fight against women abuse. Together, let’s #PressforProgress and help bring this epidemic to an end.Sources: http://www.health-genderviolence.org/guidance-for-health-care-professionals-in-strengthening-health-system-responses-to-gender-based-vi-0; http://www.osisa.org/buwa/regional/political-economy-violence-against-women-africa; https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-12-14-the-impact-of-gender-based-violence-on-the-economy/; https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/za/pdf/2017/01/za-Too-costly-to-ignore.pdf  "

        "content": "A recent study of 400 children showed that girls as young as six believe that boys and men are more likely to have ‘genius’ than girls and women. How do girls this young have such low confidence and such a prejudicial view of themselves? The researchers speculate it comes from several sources, including the media, parents, teachers, and other children.If girls and women are held back, it hurts everyone. Research shows that when women are uplifted and empowered, their families, communities, countries, and the world at large benefit and move forward. As such, we should do everything in our power to address what could be holding women back.We know that woman and child abuse play a major role in gender inequality. Think of the woman in an abusive relationship who feels she can’t leave because she has hungry young mouths to feed, but is financially dependent on her partner. She may feel trapped with no way to improve her financial situation so she can leave.The reality is, you probably know someone who is, or has been, in a similar situation. You may be the one in this situation.Physical and sexual violence are prevalent in our country. Many girls and boys see and experience abuse daily in the home, at school, and in public. With this behaviour normalised for so many children, it’s no wonder the abuse cycle continues.This may paint a bleak view of the future, but we want you to know the future is bright. As Oprah movingly said in her Golden Globe Awards speech: ‘A new day is on the horizon and when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women…and some pretty phenomenal men.’When women work together, we can do powerful things.The actions of women, no matter how small, can make a huge difference in others’ lives. Think of the recent #metoo and #timesup avalanche still rumbling through Hollywood. Sexual and physical abuse against women is, for the first time in history, being addressed head-on, and women aren’t accepting anything less than total transformation.And it all began with something seemingly small and simple: a Tweet.As a company, we’re leading the way for women and men to stand up against abuse. To date, we’ve raised R56million through the 1st for Women Foundation, where we focus on fighting woman abuse.At our recent Sisters with Blisters protest walks in Durban and Johannesburg, we raised R80,000 and R270,000 respectively for various charities that help abused women and children:The Centre for Community Justice and Development (CCJD): This organisation helps people in rural areas get legal advice and counselling about domestic violence and child abuse.Lawyers against Abuse: This non-profit gives victims of sexual and domestic violence and child abuse free legal and psychosocial support.Women and Men against Child Abuse: Committed to ending child abuse in South Africa, this organisation works to break the silence on sexual abuse of children.We also recently launched ForWomen, a platform that consolidates woman-abuse fighting efforts in one place. It’s structured to holistically address abuse through three pillars: prevention, preparation, and provision. Any woman in South Africa, regardless of who or where she is, can get help if she’s in an abusive situation. And any woman, man, or organisation can give help to women who need it.When women work together, we can be anything.There are many other organisations, locally and internationally, that are committed to advancing women’s rights in the workplace.RMB’s Athena has made bold steps to invest in young women, empower them in the workplace, and place them in deserved leadership positions.Similarly, with the knowledge that women are more confident and can accomplish more when they work together to achieve a common goal, Lean In Circles are growing in number and success around the globe.When women work together, we are unstoppable.It’s these support systems among colleagues, family, and friends that give women the space for them to be their best and most authentic selves, and speak their truth.In her Golden Globes speech, Oprah also said ‘What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have.’ It’s this truth that gives you, us, and all women – across all cultures, geography, race, and workplace – the inspiration for other women to be empowered to speak their truth, too.Only together can we bring about a gender-equal world in the home, at work, and in society.To learn more about what 1st for Women is doing to stop woman abuse and how together, our collective actions can create the most powerful change the world has ever seen, click through to ForWomen and the 1st for Women Foundation.References: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/09/gender-equality-unconscious-bias-male-privilege/; http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38717926; http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/09/education/little-girls-lose-their-self-esteem-way-to-adolescence-study-finds.html; https://africacheck.org/factsheets/guide-rape-statistics-in-south-africa/; http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/economic-empowerment/facts-and-figures; "

One, she loved to dance and two, she wanted to make a difference in people’s lives. Since then she has worked to bring both to life. Today, this international award-winning young choreographer has founded a successful dance school, that serves to empower women and girls in disadvantaged communities through the power of dance.How dancing inspires confidenceBy giving underprivileged young women and girls the opportunity to embrace dance, Corlanie has opened so many doors for aspiring dancers. Whether they want to dance for fun or to compete, she provides the platform for them to embrace their talent and love for the art form.Since starting her dance school, she has taken a number of students to competitions both locally and abroad and has even brought choreographers from the Millennial Dance Complex in Los Angeles in the United States to South Africa to mentor her students.Whether at an international competition or one of her studios in Eldorado Park, Diepsloot or Tembisa, her students feel completely at ease when it comes to expressing themselves through dance. For Corlanie, it’s not just about providing a warm and encouraging environment but also teaching the most appropriate style of dance.  A fresh and funky approachSince hip-hop culture permeates the lives of many of her students, she decided it was the ideal style to teach in her studios. The familiarity of the dance style along with the nurturing environment inspire all of Corlanie’s students to let their inner confidence shine through.Dancing her way to the topWhile training some of SA’s best talent, Corlanie has also put her talent to the test, winning two international awards, including Outstanding Coach of the World award at the World Championships of Performing Arts 2016.  But it’s not just about competing. Corlanie’s diverse skill set and infinite passion for dance takes her to the sports field and the school stage. When she’s not at her dance school Pulse, you’ll find her doing choreography for the Lions Cheerleaders and assisting with school productions.Young, funky and full of life, Corlanie is an inspiration to everyone around her and a shining example of the power of our country’s feminine youth.

        "content": "In the last few years, there has been a massive surge in the number of movements and initiatives aimed at ending woman abuse. Actions, taken by all these movements, are critical to keeping the conversation on woman abuse alive. Channelling these conversations into consistent, continuous and collective action however is the only way that we can bring the scourge to an end.  For over 13 years, we’ve been doing our part through the 1st for Women Foundation, and more recently with the launch of ForWomen.  Here are 5 ways you can make a difference:  1. Remain informedFinding a permanent solution to the multi-faceted problem of woman abuse will depend on the collective efforts of thousands of organisations and millions of people worldwide. Keeping up to date with the headway being made by the growing number of relevant movements, gives us perspective into the progress towards that solution, and provides a good idea of where and how we can help.Not only is woman abuse escalating at an alarming rate, shocking new findings reveal that what ‘warrants’ abuse can be as simple as a woman burning food or talking back. In 2018 Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) released a report titled: “Crime against women in South Africa” that highlighted an extremely worrying fact – almost as many women as men in this country believe that these examples warrant abuse.TimesLive also reported that “the highest percentage of individuals thought it was acceptable for a man to hit a woman if she argues with him.” This was based on the Stats SA report findings in addition to research from the World Health Organisation (WHO).There are plenty ways to stay informed. Visit www.for-women.co.za for access to the latest news and information on the fight against woman abuse, follow stories and find out about events taking place in your area. Click here to find out more.  2. Join a coalitionIn 2017, we launched ForWomen, an online platform that consolidates woman abuse fighting efforts and offers South Africans the chance to give and get help through a growing support network. ForWomen is structured to holistically address this epidemic through prevention, preparation and provision measures. Find out how you can give help or get help, and make your pledge at www.for-women.co.za  3. Support companies that are taking a standFrom make-up brands to financial services providers, corporates around the world have found ways to support the fight against woman abuse. One of the ways 1st for Women does it is with the help of our customers. We donate a portion of all their premiums, each month, to the 1st for Women Foundation. Since being established in 2005, the Foundation has raised over R64 million for woman abuse causes.When you take out a policy with 1st for Women, you’re not only getting insurance specifically designed for women but taking action in the fight against woman abuse.In addition, policyholders and their families automatically enjoy some of our Guardian Angel Lifestyle Assist benefits including:Expo-Sure – products provides full access to confidential HIV testing and treatment within the critical 72-hour window period after accidental exposure, including that resulting from sexual assault.Medical Assist – provides access to trauma counselling in the event of sexual assault.4.

        "content": "A criminal justice system that works, that seeks to hold offenders accountable and provides the support that survivors deserve – this is the vision that inspired the 1st for Women Foundation to donate R950 000 to Rape Crisis Cape Town Trust.  The Trust is faced with addressing the following shocking statistics:49 960 sexual offences were reported in the 2016/17 period, according to Crime Statistics published by the South African Police Service, however, Rape Crisis Cape Town Trust says that as few as one in nine survivors reports crimes due to lack of faith in the criminal justice system. Taking this into consideration the number of reported sexual offences could increase exponentially to close on 450 000. With the support of the 1st for Women Foundation, Rape Crisis Cape Town Trust is determined to significantly decrease these numbers through the establishment of more specialised sexual offences courts. These courts provide critical support for rape survivors and are proven to increase conviction rates and decrease the time taken to finalise cases. These are facts that could result in fundamental change, bringing more offenders to justice and providing hope for thousands of survivors – and a plan of action is already in place through the organisation’s Rape Survivors’ Justice Campaign.The Rape Survivors’ Justice Campaign advocates for the planned and funded rollout of specialised sexual offences courts as well as the laws which govern and regulate them. The aim is to ensure higher conviction rates of perpetrators and to reduce the rates of secondary trauma experienced by survivors. The government has promised to roll out ten new sexual offences courts, per year, over the next three years, across South Africa – and the Rape Survivors’ Justice Campaign plans to hold them accountable for this.While the introduction of new sexual offences courts is a tremendous step towards keeping more SA women safe, more can and must be done to bring this epidemic to an end. For over 13 years, we’ve been doing our part through the 1st for Women Foundation, to which we donate a portion of our customers’ premiums every month. Last year we expanded our efforts with the launch of ForWomen, a site which consolidates woman abuse fighting efforts and provides South Africans with the opportunity to get help or give help in the fight against woman abuse. The more we work together, the bigger the impact we’ll make and the closer we’ll be to finally ending the scourge.

But it hasn’t always been this way. At three years old, Sarah was an outgoing little girl, who spent her days in carefree bliss, just the way children should. But the bright light that twinkled in her eyes was dulled when men she knew took advantage of her innocence and destroyed it. Like millions of women around the world, she is a survivor of abuse. On the outside, Sarah’s life was just what any little girl could wish for. She lived in a lovely home in suburbia, and as the youngest by 13 years, she was doted on by her much older siblings. Her parents were career-driven and she was mostly raised by nannies in her early childhood. Everyone loved her dearly but between her travelling parents and her pre-occupied teenage siblings, no one noticed that at around the age of three, Sarah began to change. It was during this year, and part of the following one that Sarah was raped, repeatedly, by three different men. While she knew what was happening to her was wrong, she never told anyone. In a lonely world of her own, Sarah suffered feelings of fear, guilt and shame. When she was five years old, Sarah’s family moved to a new neighbourhood, where her perpetrators would no longer have any access to her. Her parents hired a new nanny, who Sarah describes as nothing less than a Godsend. Between her new nanny, and her sister, Sarah was loved and protected, and would never have to experience rape again. But still Sarah kept quiet about the trauma she survived. The years flew by and it wasn’t until early adulthood that she began battling with depression, and became reckless and self-sabotaging. When she started struggling at university, she decided to seek counselling but dredging up the past only seemed to make things worse. So she stopped but her aggression and carelessness only escalated. The immense pressure from her family however forced her to take charge of her studies again and she completed her degree. It was shortly thereafter that Sarah met her first love. The relationship was good but when her boyfriend broke things off, it sent her into a downward spiral. Suddenly Sarah was drowning. The breakup felt like confirmation of all the terrible things she thought about herself:“You’re nothing.” “You’re not good enough and never will be.” “Why would anyone truly love you?”“You are only good for one thing.”“You are not beautiful in any way, shape or form.”Sarah spent the next few years constantly seeking validation from others and working relentlessly to prove people (and herself) wrong. “I wanted to be better and be good enough,” she says. But every time Sarah took one step forward, she would do something that would take her two steps back. She became obsessed with her weight to a point where she stared death in the face. After overdosing on weight-loss drugs and waking up in hospital, Sarah remembers two significant events that would change the course of her life. The first was saying a prayer, and the second was rediscovering what truly made her happy. The two coincided in a way Sarah never could have imagined. Singing as a child in her school choir had brought Sarah great joy, so she began looking for a choir to join. The only ones she could find however were church choirs – and she wasn’t Christian – so when she found a church choir which welcomed her irrespective of her religious beliefs, she was overjoyed. “I went with the intention to sing only. No religious stuff,” Sarah recalls, “but after the first service I attended I felt an instant connection with God.”Two weeks later Sarah’s father passed away, suddenly. Instead of the downward spiral that a loss like this would have triggered in the past, Sarah prayed for strength and took in all the love and support of her family and friends, and her new-found church group. Sarah not only survived the ordeal but began to thrive. At a women’s camp, arranged by the church, not long after her father’s passing, Sarah opened up about her past through prayer. “I shared everything with God, from being raped to every reckless decision I ever made,” Sarah says. The experience was like magic. “I could stand still and breathe for the very first time in my life.” Sarah says the experience not only changed her but empowered her to help other woman abuse survivors. Truly understanding the emotional, mental and physical damage of abuse has allowed her to connect with these women and to help them rebuild their lives. For Sarah, song and prayer were central to regaining her confidence, and forgiving her perpetrators, and herself.  “It took me a long time to forgive myself,” says Sarah. “I would often think: why didn’t I just say no?” Knowing how long and hard she fought to finally believe that the abuse was not her fault, has allowed Sarah to encourage other women to realise and embrace their true value. Sarah wants every women who has ever been subjected to abuse, or is in an abusive situation, to know this: “You can be happy, you are good enough, you are loved, you are worthy, you do belong, and you are beautiful.”Through sheer determination and with the help of friends, family and the church community, Sarah took back control of her life. Having a strong support network has played a critical role in her journey of hope and triumph. Every woman who has survived abuse, or is being abused, deserves the same, and that network can grow far beyond their immediate circle because when we come together we are stronger than we are alone. This is the sentiment that inspired 1st for Women to launch ForWomen – a place where woman abuse fighting efforts come together and where those who need help can find it, quickly, and those who want to help can lend a hand.

With their assistance of ewallet vouchers, Bridget was able to launch her feeding scheme and help provide much-needed food relief to her community.But to keep going, a larger cash injection was needed. Inspired by the tremendous work she’d already done, 1st for Women Insurance donated an additional R10 000 to boost Bridget’s admirable efforts.Thanks to the additional funding, Bridget was able to continue her feeding scheme, which provides four meals per week to her community. In one day alone, she feeds at least 500 people. And with an icy winter already in full swing, she tries her best to further assist the elderly with warm clothing like gowns and slippers.To keep meeting the growing demand for food relief, Bridget has some further needs including a food processor and a new fridge.

        "description": "",
        "content": "The following is based on an interview by Sanabelle Ebrahim with Prof Quarraisha Abdool Karim.Stellar scientist, Prof Quarraisha Abdool Karim finds interacting with students “very inspiring and rewarding especially when I see how confident and self-assured they are about what they want to accomplish as scientists and have the focus and drive to pursue it.”A powerhouse of knowledge, expertise and unwavering commitment to her work and the wider community, Prof Abdool Karim is an academic, a mother and a globally recognised leader in HIV prevention and treatment research. She is an Associate Scientific Director of the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA).“As long as I can remember, I have been curious and being a scientist was a natural career choice for me. Generating new knowledge is a very long and slow process and challenging as you more often end up with a negative result than a positive one. You need to be very passionate about what you are doing so that when you encounter failure you are able to reflect on it and move forward building on the lessons learnt. You need persistence as you can’t give up every time you fail. Having a goal one is passionate about gives one resilience to keep focused and continue despite adversity encountered along the way,” she acknowledges. I met Prof Abdool Karim at a Minara Women’s Association (MWA) meeting where she shared an inspiring presentation on her work with women and HIV prevention. She strikes me as a woman with breadth of vision; someone who empowers women by listening to their concerns and seeking out practical solutions to improve their plight. It is the sense of agency that her work affords women that is perhaps most admirable.Her work seeks to give adolescent girls and young women the opportunity to live HIV free and make their full contributions to society.When asked to comment on the defining moment that brought about her success, she says: “I don’t think I can pinpoint a moment as my scientific contributions have grown slowly over three decades to the point in 2010 where we demonstrated for the first time that the use of antiretrovirals could prevent HIV in women.”Her dream for the future is to expand this early work and ensure that women have an array of safe and effective prevention options.Her biggest fear is “complacency – it is the death knell to progress.”She is a member of the Executive Group of the World Health Organization (WHO) International Steering Committee for the Covid-19 Solidarity Trial and the South African Ministerial Advisory Committee on Covid-19.“The Executive Group provides oversight of the conduct of the largest multi-country, multi-centre trial evaluating multiple drugs to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 in hospitalised patients in the midst of a pandemic and where our knowledge continues to evolve. This includes monitoring the trial progress in terms of enrolments; safety of participants; monitoring data from other studies and its implications for the Solidarity trial products being evaluated; and identifying new products for inclusion in the trial.”“The South African Covid-19 Ministerial Advisory Committee provides advice to the Minister of Health on how to enhance the response to Covid-19 based on the best knowledge available.  As an infectious diseases epidemiologist, my contributions are primarily in the public health space.”  She is a Living Legend for the City of Durban – an honour bestowed by the city for citizens who have made an exemplary contribution to increase the profile of the city nationally and internationally.“For working parents, balancing home and work life is a challenge and especially when you have young children. I have a supportive family who are all hard working and passionate about our careers but also appreciate the importance of quality family time that we are protective of.  Having shared values helps with striking a good balance.”Her advice to the women of South Africa: “It is your time to shine. You have many opportunities to make a difference, seize them and soar! Be the architect of your own destiny!”"

        "content": "What would you do if you were fearless?Have you really ever asked yourself that question? Think about the answer:Would you say what you’ve always wanted to say?Would you go places that you’ve only dreamed of?Would you do things you thought you couldn’t?Pretty incredible right? Pretty fearless right? Did you know that you are a pretty incredible, pretty fearless woman? And that you have everything within you to do absolutely anything you want – to say what you want to say and go where you want to go?So, the next question is why aren’t you doing it? Well, sometimes the hardest part is just getting started. It’s those niggling fears and doubts in the back of our minds that can get in the way. They can cause us to lose motivation and question whether we really have what it takes.It’s in these moments, it’s critical to have a push of encouragement, a message that matters, something that helps us believe that we can do and be what we’ve always wanted.  And sometimes that encouragement can be as simple as intentional words on a garmentCan you think of something that represents this? We can: the statement T-shirt – a fashion trend which conveys identity, truth and meaning of an attitude or belief towards a cause – intentional words on a garment that become a wearable and powerful piece of art.This ignited in us the idea of creating our very own statement T-shirt that inspires women to realise their inherent, strength, resolve and power – to be Fearless. To take the first step in squashing those fears and doubts and embracing the inherent confidence within us, to say and do the things we want.We then had one more question to answer: Who could help us bring this audacious vision to life? The answer? Collaborating with two fearless women who have forged ahead, inspiring and motivating the women of South Africa through relentlessly pursuing their dreams and remaining unapologetically true to who they are: Palesa Mokubung and Zozibini Tunzi.Palesa is the heart and brains behind Mantsho – the first South African brand to collaborate with fashion powerhouse, H&amp;M. Known for her iconic bold prints and confident styles, centred on celebrating the beauty, diversity and vibrancy of women, Palesa was the obvious choice.Zozibini smashed through beauty stereotypes with her iconic hairstyle, refusing to adhere to beauty pageantry norms, remaining authentically true to her roots from winning Miss South Africa to being crowned Miss Universe. But far from beauty alone, Zozi has become famous for advocating for female leadership and encouraging women to “take up space in society and cement themselves” – a statement which has resonated with women far and wide. In addition to her focus on garnering female leadership, she is a resounding voice in the fight against gender-based violence and we are incredibly proud to align with her as our Fearless ambassador.And thus the collaboration of 1st for Women x Mantsho x Zozibini was born and the result is a Fearless statement T-shirt, with meaning, purpose and power in every stitch – in essence, a statement T-shirt like no other.All the reasons to buy the fearless statement T-shirt:It is an outward statement to the rest of the world of your intentionIt encourages an attitude of fearlessness – it is a tangible reminder that you have everything you need within you to be who you want to be and do what you want to do.It encourages you to answer the question: What would you do if you were fearless? And motivates you to pursue and implement the answer in your everyday life.It is never about being reckless but rather about making an informed decision to go after the things that ignite the fire in our bellies and hearts.In addition to making a statement, it is making a difference in the lives of thousands of South African women because 20% of all proceeds will be donated to the 1st for Women Foundation. To date the Foundation has raised over R81 million to fight women abuse and assisted over 90 000 survivors – and with every purchase, we can help even more.So, don’t wait another second, do this for yourself, do it for the women of South Africa. Get your Fearless T-shirt and become part of the Fearless Collective on our Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages.There are two different Fearless T-shirt designs, so you can choose the one that best suits your style."

        "content": "Fear is a part of life but it doesn’t have to be all of it. And when we face our fears, despite our trembling hands and feelings of self-doubt, we strengthen our ability to overcome them – because being fearless is not the absence of fear but choosing to forge ahead anyway.In the words of Judy Blume “Each of us must confront our own fears, must come face to face with them. How we handle our fears will determine where we go with the rest of our lives.”With this in mind, we asked our customers to write to us about a fear they overcame - and these are some of many incredible answers we received. Everything from surviving a brain tumor to succeeding in predominately male industries.Here are just 7 of the stories shared – all demonstrating women’s ability to forge ahead with sheer grit, resilience and determination.Maentle MofokengFear of the unknown. I still remember the day, when I was diagnosed with a brain tumor :15/12/2017. The biggest fear that I had was will I survive the operation? Will my life be the same, will I be able to walk, talk, continue with my career as a nurse, will I be the same person, will I be able to drive my car again, most of all I have family and kids to take care of, so many questions that I couldn\"t answer during that time. But as a strong woman I have faith because anything that I fear, I just look up and pray therefore I become fearless. Here I am today no double vision, no more paralysis of my left side of the body, I am back on my feet again FEARLESS.Slungile NdabaI remember when I went through the divorce with my husband and I had to start afresh with my two boys. The fear in me badly wanted to hang on to a toxic marriage and not move forward, as I was scared that I could not make it on my own. I remember the crippling fear, that screamed louder, telling me, how I have failed my kids. The fear was so bad that I would have panic attacks. I felt humiliated that as young as I am, I could not make my marriage work. But I faced my biggest fear and step by step I faced the fear of being alone and raising my boys. I faced the crippling voice inside of me that told me I could not make it.  I bought my boys a house, I have healed, I no longer have the fear that I\"m not worthy because I know I am a fearless woman destined for greatness.Bessie MpeGreetings. Being fearless is one of the biggest obstacles that one has to overcome.  I remember telling my family how I wanted to do medicine, to provide good health services for my people, back then it seemed impossible and no one believed in me. My parents couldn\"t afford to take me to Varsity but luckily, I got a bursary and studied. I had to believe in myself throughout, I am the first medical doctor in my family, believing in myself when no one else did and still being able to finish medical school in record time is incredible. I am from a poor background, raised by a single parent. Where I come from most girls don\"t see themselves accomplishing their career goals and taking up space. I believe all women have the right to dream and follow their dreams. I believe in the woman being Imbokoto.Jeannette MoodleyIn 2010 just after the completion of the famous soccer world cup l became the victim of a hijacking.  I was waiting outside my kid’s school waiting for them to come when I saw three males approach the car in front of me. I realised they were hijackers and started my car. Unfortunately, I could not get out in time. The one guy started banging on my window with the butt of a gun asking me to jump off. I told myself that I was going to get away no matter what.  I jumped over his extended hand and bailed out of the car like I was in an action movie. I rolled down the bank while a shot was fired. They got away in my car. It was a harrowing experience. I was shattered by the trauma of it all.  I realised though that if I did not face my fear head on, I would never drive again. The next day I gingerly stepped into my husband\"s car and made that trip back to school to fetch my children. It was the longest and most arduous journey I ever made but I was triumphant because I did not let these criminals deter me for life. For a long while I battled with the fear of being hijacked again whenever any suspicious people approached me when driving my car but I slowly overcame this and now ten years later I am a stronger and fearless woman.Tanya MalulekeI am a 30-year-old Mechanical Engineer. In a male dominated field, as a woman you are made to feel that you are not as capable as your male counterparts and you fear that you will never be good enough. That is something I have left in the past...I live fearlessly now because I am able to conquer and thrive where I was once made to believe that I do not belong.Martha RakhathoeWhen I was around 10 years old, my uncle used to visit my home and he would always bring sweets for me and my brother. He would also give my mother money and other things. We loved him so much and got very excited when we saw him.  He used to put me on his lap and ask me about school etc, I would feel very happy. That excitement changed to fear when one day whilst on his lap he started to touch me in the way that it did not feel right to me. He would do that when my mother went the kitchen to prepare food or something for him.  Because everybody loved him it was difficult to tell my mom. This happened repeatedly. Sometimes I would hide in the bedroom but he or my mom would call me out. I did not tell anyone until I passed my matric. During those years abuse was never discussed openly. I studied Social Work in order to help children that are going through the same thing and create awareness. Through counselling my clients, I got healed and gained confidence. I’m a strong woman now and I can stand my ground. I am fearless. Rolina SmitHello to all the Fearless woman out there! For 3 and a half years I was caught up in a very abusive marriage. I could not sleep and was anxious all the time. I started losing hair, became despondent and found myself in a situation where I did not want to go home after work. I don\"t know how I managed to focus at work at all. The situation at home affected all my other relationships as well (parents, family, friends as well as colleagues) and I ended up angry all the time. At some point I realised enough was enough. I realised I am a STRONG woman, a warrior not a worrier, and only I could change the course I was on. I decided to put an end to my marriage and not a single day has gone by that I am not thankful for being BRAVE and FEARLESS! Thank you to all the women who shared their fearless stories with us. For all that you have fought through and continue to fight through, we applaud you."

        "content": "Josina Machel was raised by great fighters and activists. But that life has come with its fair share of tragedy. The loss of her father, Mozambican president Samora Machel, in a plane crash that is still shrouded in suspicion, the death of her step-father, Nelson Mandela, and a brutal attack in a case of domestic abuse that has left her blind in one eye. Yet, she continues to fearlessly stand her ground and champion for other survivors who don’t have a voice!We’re honoured to share this impactful conversation between Josina and news anchor and journalist, Uveka Rangappa, on how she remains fearless through it all.What are the events in your life that have shaped you and made you fearless?Being beaten to a pulp and running screaming for help, was the first manifestation of my fearlessness. Weeks later, I realised that in order to tell my own story and allow other women to tell theirs, I needed to be courageous. In that moment of finding my life purpose, I realised I was fearless!At what point did you decide to do something about the abuse?After being beaten, I had injuries, but I did not know I had been blinded in one eye. I decided to report it because I know my “humanness” had been reduced and I couldn’t stay silent. I didn’t know where the journey would take me, but I knew that abuse was not tolerable.Faced with such tragedies in life, many women become and stay victims. How did you become a survivor and not a victim?I value life and it’s a privilege to be still breathing. My father, Samora Machel, fulfilled his life purpose and that allowed me to live fully and fulfil my own purpose. That has inspired my work with women who are continually robbed of their dignity in private and public. My fathers (Samora and Madiba) instilled in me the sense of uniqueness, love and respect which every girl in the world deserves.The guilty verdict against your alleged attacker was overturned. Do you feel let down by the justice system?In this case, justice has been bought. But its price is not eternal. A state of injustice will never prevail. I believe in justice, if not of men, justice of God.You were also threatened and intimidated when you reported this attack but you didn’t back down. How did you not crumble?The truth cannot crumble. My aggressor tried to intimidate and kill my voice, but my truth stood me firm. I was scared into making changes in my life but I could not be scared into lying.But you must still have moments where you are fearful – how do you overcome?I spent many nights afraid for my life and I was fearful for what could happen to my children. In the moments when fear grips me, I retreat into the memory of a 4-year-old Josina who believed in the goodness and fairness of the world.You founded the Kuhluka Movement to help other survivors – how do you empower them?Victims of gender-based violence can suffer from life-long PTSD. That suffering is ingrained in our DNA and we need to deal with it long term. ALWAYS REMEMBER: There is NEVER an excuse for abuse. If someone is abusing you or someone in your home, you do not have to accept it or protect them.Do you think fearlessness is something we are born with or something we have to learn?We are all born fearless. Fear is taught to us from a young age and reinforced throughout our lives. We should live with enough fear to ensure survival, but not fear of being who we are because then we stop living fully!"

        "content": "Imagine being the right hand, eyes and ears of one of the most revered men on the planet? Zelda La Grange spent nearly 20 years being all of that and more to Nelson Mandela.What was that like for a young Afrikaans girl?  And what about “Life After Madiba” and fear of the unknown?  Zelda La Grange tells journalist and news anchor, Uveka Rangappa what it means to be fearless in times of change, uncertainty and moving on… You were a young Afrikaans girl, working for one of the greatest men in history, at a time of great change in SA. How scared were you?I was a naive Afrikaans girl who knew very little about what really happened in SA.  I hoped I would never have to greet the President. We were brought up fearing him. I even locked my office door the first few days when I heard him arrive. But my world changed irrevocably when I met him.  Was young Zelda born fearless or did she learn to become fearless? Both.  I was a shy child but my brother challenged me and made me an adventurous and naughty teen.  I also took acting lessons, determined to become an actress.  But all that confidence meant nothing the day I walked into my new world in 1994.  One of the first lessons President Mandela taught me was to be courageous.  He once got so angry with me for agreeing to run an errand which he considered humiliating. He called me to his house and told me that if I couldn’t stand up for myself, I wouldn’t last long in that environment.  I had to grow up very fast.    Your identity was and still is in many ways linked to Madiba’s. When he passed,  did you feel just a little afraid/lost? I realise things will happen exactly as and when they must. I think I really only started feeling the impact of the loss last year during hard lockdown.  No work, no-where to go – just myself. It was traumatic and I came to understand what I had been through for 20 years but also what I’d lost.   Many women are afraid of change. They stay in unhappy/abusive relationships or jobs they hate. What would you say to them?People simply do not know how scared, broken, disappointed I have been in my life but I pushed through. Once you liberate yourself from everything that holds you back, you feel rejuvenated. Things always get worse before they get better. But our intuition is our strongest weapon as women. Invest in people who will support you once you take the leap and you will fly.    Many women are also afraid of their own power – they don’t try for fear of failure or not being good enough. What do you say to them?Many people openly complained and were jealous of my closeness to Madiba. Mrs Machel sat me down one day and asked me why I found it necessary to defend Madiba\"s decisions. She told me he had chosen ME and despite many people confronting him about it, they could never change his mind. I accepted that and once I realised I wouldn’t be able to please everyone all of the time, intense gratitude replaced my feelings of doubt and  inadequacy. Being afraid is very different to allowing fear to control you. What you should be afraid of is NOT taking the first step to bring about change. It’s okay to be afraid of failure but that fear should never control you. You should control it!  (Zelda La Grange is a renowned motivational speaker and author.  She currently co-hosts the Afrikaans women’s talk show \"Tussen Ons\" on Kyknet &amp;Kie and is setting up an online gift shop. She lives in the Overstrand .)  "

Below is Jenny’s story…“Dear 1st for Women A few weeks ago, I had the unfortunate experience of hitting a pothole during heavy rains, at night and it had a massive impact on my car. The car slowed down and just stopped - dead stopped. As a woman, I panicked and had no understanding of what was happening. I waited a few minutes to try and start it again, but my darling car was quiet. I sat in wonder, then realised I need to call for help. I called 1st for Women and from the very beginning, I had the most supportive responses. The consultant asked for my location, explained what needed to happen and said they will get help right away. I must mention just how comforting they approached the situation. They were so kind, spoke very tenderly and so calmly. It made me feel calm during a storm (literally).To summarise the month-long experience of events, I felt supported throughout my entire experience. I was walked through each stage of the claims process (this was after all my first claims experience ever!). I mean everyone I engaged with was so incredibly patient, answered my silly questions and told me information I needed and when I needed it. All this done in honesty and transparency.I had an incredible claims consultant - Ayanda Feti. I honestly felt he was truly holding my hand (virtually). My claims \"big brother\". His professionalism, reassurance, positivity, honesty and constant updates kept me completely comfortable and at ease. I even forgot I was in the middle of a claims process, imagine that!I am crying tears of joy and sitting in deep appreciation as I write this email. I felt guided, supported and reassured. You have amazing staff and service providers who truly helped me manage this experience comfortably.1st for Women, really does walk the talk and talk the walk. It has been an incredible experience, even if it was triggered by an \"accident\". You are deeply appreciated! You have impacted my life so positively.A lifelong customer indeed!”"

        "content": "When you’re the granddaughter of Nelson Mandela and come from one of the most revered struggle families in the world, you would imagine a protected life. Zoleka Mandela’s life has been anything but that. She has suffered sexual abuse as a child, the loss of her young daughter in a car crash in 2010, the death of her newborn son a year later, the deaths of her grandparents and then the loss of her mother Zindzi to COVID last year. Zoleka has also battled addiction, breast cancer and attempted suicide. Zoleka Mandela told journalist and news anchor, Uveka Rangappa, how she has come out on the other side a Fearless inspiration for millions.We’re honoured to share this moving conversation between Zoleka and news anchor and journalist, Uveka Rangappa, on how she remains fearless through it all. You have experienced all this pain in your life, how have you kept going?There are days I find myself drowning in my own tears, when breathing, feeling, or just being feels like an effort. On those days I remind myself to be more gentle with myself, to be patient and more understanding of what I’m feeling and why. I live with depression and anxiety. To keep myself going I have to give myself time to feel what I feel and accept that what I’m going through is quite normal and very human. Would you say you were Fearless to start and that is what carried you through or did you become Fearless because of it all?I absolutely cannot say that I was fearless from the start. What carried me through for a very long time were both my late grandmother (Winnie Madikizela-Mandela) and late mother (Zindzi Mandela). I haven’t always given my mother the credit she deserves for instilling so much resilience in me, for arming me with self-will and a thick skin. I come from a line of tremendously powerful women, but it is both my grandmother and mother I have to thank for the woman I am today. At what point would you say you realised you were Fearless?I guess it was more of a hint than a realisation, back in 2010, shortly after checking out of rehab where I battled alcohol and cocaine addiction. I’ve always feared facing my own demons. I tried to silence the loudness for years. Having to confront so much about myself sober is fearful but I’ve learnt it’s achievable. This year in August, I celebrate eleven years of sobriety and that to me is fearlessness!You talk openly about your tragedies and life experiences   – many people can’t. How are you able to? I wrote my autobiography, When Hope Whispers in 2013, with a purpose. I wanted to share all aspects of my life, good and bad because I was hoping others could relate and then share their own stories. It was important for me to remind readers that despite what family I come from, tragedy has still penetrated my life. Talking about it has encouraged more women to own their stories and change their narratives.  It’s never too late to rewrite our life stories. Many women who have experienced sexual abuse, addiction or attempted suicide are often ashamed or afraid to talk about it. What do you say to them?I was sexually abused from the age of nine up until my teenage years by family members, family friends and adults who were supposed to care for me. I only disclosed to my family when I was 21 because I blamed myself! Parts of me still carry blame for having kept quiet. The reality is those acts were consciously committed by my abusers and none of it was my fault. I would say to them they are never alone and that it’s never their fault. I would encourage them to speak out, to remind them that all our stories are crucial in effecting change and breaking silence. You’ve opened up to love again – is that scary for you?It was unexpected but it undoubtedly feels right. I just want to be happy. I was so incredibly unhappy in my marriage. I stayed for my kids but then realized I was responsible for my own happiness. I can no longer allow any past relationship to prevent me from receiving love. Maybe it will work out, maybe it won’t – either way it’s ok!Many people are struggling right now - they’ve lost one or more loved ones – what do you say to them about going on with life?After losing two children, my grandparents, my mother and one of my sisters, I’ve never understood why people constantly feel the need to tell me that time heals. Grief and loss are forever, and time has never healed any of it for me. In my experience, honouring their spirit and memory, the best way I can, has made life more bearable. It’s not easy and it takes time, but you can always seek help when it all becomes too difficult. "

        "description": "",
        "content": "We all remember the late Nelson Mandela for many reasons. His relentless fight for freedom and equality. His unwavering hope and endearing humility. His strength, courage and wisdom. What we also remember is his contagious smile, the famous Madiba Dance and of course, his iconic shirts. We know that from his earliest public appearances (following the 1994 elections) Madiba donned bold printed shirts in kaleidoscopic colour – a far cry from the sold muted tones of regular politicians. What not many of us don’t know is how the Madiba shirts came to be. And that’s why we’re here to tell you this incredible story. It started one day in 1994, at the most unlikely of places…9 May 1994: A brief, bold, brave encounterDesré Buirski was a woman with a simple dream but one she’d envisioned for years – to give Nelson Mandela a gift. She had learned from a friend that Madiba was to appear at the Marais Street Synagogue, in Seapoint that day. She was elated at her opportunity to achieve her dream, however slim her possibilities. Bracing a crowd of thousands, she determinedly inched her way to the front, where she seized the perfect moment – reaching the front of the crowd as Madiba was ushered into his awaiting car, followed by one of his guards.Before his security detail had a chance to intervene, the window rolled down and without hesitation she spoke: ‘I’d like to give Madiba a gift.’ Hesitant but not alarmed, the guard inside whistled his permission to a colleague, who’d overheard the request. Desré handed him the packaged and once satisfied that is wasn’t dangerous, popped it into the boot. Desré too was satisfied, she’d achieved her dream and life would return to normal… or so she thought.A few days later: Fortune favours the fearless Desré, the woman with the dream fulfilled and the owner of a designer boutique at the V&amp;A Waterfront, was driving home from work when her phone rang. The excited voice of a good friend boomed down the line:“Have you seen Die Burger today?” “No, I’ve never read it in my life,” she replied, startled and confused.“Go buy it right now!”Intrigued by the strange call, Desré turned around and headed for the nearest shop, grabbed a copy and raced home, where she eagerly flipped through the pages until she spotted it – a picture of Madiba at his dress rehearsal for the opening of parliament. He was wearing the gift she’d given him.&lt;Insert pic of him in Fish shirt&gt;Desré pinched herself to check she wasn’t dreaming. She sat down and recalled the day before she met Madiba, the year preceding it and the serendipitous series of events that lead to this exact moment.Desré, who moved to the Unite States with her family during Apartheid, felt a yearning to come home when she heard a speech by Madiba prior to the 1994 elections. In it, he called on those who had left the country to return and bring back the skills they’d learned – of which Desré had plenty. She’d spent decades in the fashion industry, travelling the world, sourcing material and designing garments. His speech resonated with her at a time she desperately needed a change and so she packed her bags and flew back home.In her rush to pack her merchandise (planning to open a shop in SA) she’d forgotten one male dress shirt that was hanging in her closet. So, she threw in with her clothes and forgot all about it until the night she was searching for Madiba’s gift.You see Desré knew she wanted to give the new president something but because the opportunity to see him arose so fast, she hadn’t thought about what to give him. That’s when she began rummaging through her wardrobe and found the dress shirt. It was still brand-new, the swing tag from her American shop (Desré’s Exotic Imports) still attached.But it wasn’t ideal – it was a size extra-large; it didn’t have the most exciting pattern and it was crinkled from the journey. But it would have to do. He can give it away or wear it as PJs, she thought, carefully wrapping it. Then there was the question of a card – she didn’t have that either so she grabbed a business card and wrote a short message. And that’s how she’d delivered her present.Desré never expected anything in return for the gift. Her dream was simply to give it to Madiba. But the universe had a far more spectacular plan in mind. In her heart, she knew this was the beginning of something extremely special. So the very next day she called the barely open parliament and asked to speak to Madiba’s PA, with whom she would develop a close friendship. The two stayed in touch over the years to arrange the order and delivery of over 200 shirts for Madiba and countless more bulk orders for guests at many prestigious events.When the call ended, Desré once again felt elated, surely she couldn’t expect even more from this already unbelievable experience. Think again Desré…One day in December 1994: The letter that led to a lifelong friendshipA letter arrives in Desré’s post. It’s from Madiba. She shakily opens it and is overwhelmed with emotion. In it he thanks Desré for the first shirt and for the many others that followed since. And the one line in the letter she treasures, the line that affirms her burning desire all those years ago, to return home…“In order for the birth of a new nation, we need many more Desrés.” Fast forward to May 1995 – Breakfast with Madiba The months following the letter were a whirlwind of activity and passed by in a flash. But the unexpected events related to their blooming friendship had only just began. This time it was a call from Mary inviting Desré to breakfast the with Madiba the following day.The next morning, Desré arrived at the Office of the Presidency (De Tuynhuys, in Cape Town) a bundle of nerves. The next thing she knows, she was in the warm embrace of her hero, crying into the lapel of his shirt.“It’s such an honour to meet you,” said Madiba.To overwhelmed to speak in that moment – all she could think was: He’s honoured to meet me? I am the one who should’ve said that!A few minutes later…After holding her in a warm hug for what felt like an eternity, the two moved into his office, where Desré tried her best to regain her composure and sit upright in a comfortable, well worn leather couch where the two fell into easy conversation –  the first of many in the years to come.The following years Desré became not just Madiba’s designer but his friend. Over the years she would be invited to attend events with guests like Bill Clinton, the King and Queen of Spain, Fedal Castro and of course, Graça Machel, with whom she formed a special bond.She also met the SA ambassador to Greece who had purchased the famous fish shirt for R18 000 at a charity auction. In 2014, she even had the opportunity to speak about her relationship with Madiba at a UN conference.Up until his retirement, Desré was a familiar guest in his home, where he shared anecdotes like a call from Giorgio Armani. The famous designed was offended that Madiba chose ‘loud’ shirts in favour of the sophisticated suites he’d sent him. Years after Madiba passed Desré would also see an interview where Desmond Tutu questioned Madiba’s wardrobe choice. The president’s response?  “With all due respect there is no point holding a meeting with no solution.”  One final project In the years that Desré had been designing for Madiba, a good friend gave her some advice – keep the offcuts of all the shirts you make. She listened and one day the idea for a quilt came to her. But when she’d finished making it and put it on her bed, it just didn’t feel right.A few days later, another idea came to her. She would convert it into a wall hanging which Madiba could auction for the Nelson Mandela Foundation. This dream came true too when the wall hanging was purchased by the Co-Founder of Microsoft at an auction in Monaco – for €360 000.The conclusion of an incredible journey… and onto the next oneIn 2010, Desré published a book ‘Mandela’s shirts &amp; me’ which she sums up her journey beautifully – especially the final paragraph:‘My life’s journey has been intricately woven with my dreams, and goals, all spun into a patchwork of small and large miracles. Each patch representing a part of my life’s experience as the woman privileged to be the shirt maker for such an incredible human being.’‘I am not done dreaming’So, what has the courageous and talented Desré been doing since then? Well, that’s another fearless story for another time…  "

        "content": " This Women\"s Month, 1st for Women has teamed up with speaker, trainer and author, Lori Milner, to bring you The Ultimate Guide To Showing Up To Yourself in Life &amp; Business.  Want to build new habits and actually sustain them?  Want to manage your inner critic, free of anxiety and fear?  Lori has the answers. Last week we discussed letting go of perfection and focusing on the process, not the outcome.  If you haven’t read this blog post, you can do so here .  Today, we’ll list some more tools needed to show up to yourself in life and business.  Starting with: Celebrate your win“Belief without talent can take you further than talent without belief. But when you have both, you’re unstoppable.” – Marisa Peer A micro win can be doing 10 minutes of yoga, exercise, reading, studying an online course – whatever the task is for you.  It is so crucial to acknowledge the victory, no matter how small. Celebrate yourself! You proved that you are worth it, and you can achieve what you set out to do. When you show up to yourself and make progress on your goal – you win the day! BJ Fogg is a Stanford Professor and author of Tiny Habits. He advocates that celebrating your victory immediately after the action is the missing ingredient to habit formation. It is the intensity of the emotion linked to that behaviour that locks it in. He calls this feeling ‘Shine’. You had experienced it many times, like when you did that excellent presentation, and everyone clapped, or you aced a challenging exam. Examples of celebration could be a positive phrase like ‘That’s what I’m talking about’ or visualising fireworks going off or give yourself a high five. This step cannot be missed even if you feel silly because it is critical to your brain encoding a new habit. Fogg explains that ‘Your ability to ignore self-criticism and embrace feeling good about your successes will ripple out into your life in positive ways that go far beyond the Tiny Habits you create and celebrate’. Apart from the habit you are cultivating, you are training yourself to be kinder to yourself and acknowledge the person you are becoming along the way. It is the habit of accepting self-praise that will reap the rewards long after the goal is reached.2. Aim for progress“Progress, not perfection is what we should be asking of ourselves” – Julia CameronWhen you decide to start on something new, accept that you will not be perfect initially. This insecurity of not mastering something straight away creates a sense of loss of control and anxiety. Somehow you have this expectation that you should be able to be proficient immediately.  If you want to start a blog on your industry, the first few won’t be your best, but you will be way ahead by the time you get to blog number twenty. If you want to launch online workshops or begin a new hobby, accept that the first few times will be shaky. Aim for progress each time you do it but make sure you take that step. Trust the learning period until you build on your skills. During Lockdown, Lori’s son taught her an important lesson. “He is seven years old and enjoys playing the XBOX game Minecraft. He decided to create YouTube videos to teach people skills. He worked towards a set of headphones, and the day they arrived, he went straight into the action. He recorded his first three videos and uploaded them to Stitcher for the public to view. I was blown away by his confidence and belief in himself to get going.  As adults, we would look at where it’s not great and criticise the production and most likely wait for it to be perfect before having the courage to upload it,” says Lori. Next week, we’ll discuss more ways in which you can show up to yourself in life &amp; business. Until then remember, above all, be kind to yourself."

        "content": "Lebogang Mashile is a celebrated, award winning poet, actress, musician, TV show host and activist. She also gained significant attention for her resurrection of the story of Saartjie Baartman - a Khoi woman who was exhibited as a “freak” in 19th century Europe. Lebo wanted to highlight the effects of slavery and hypersexualisation of the black female body. She has also hosted parenting show Great Expectations together with news anchor and journalist Uveka Rangappa. Uveka caught up with her old friend to talk about what it means to be Fearless …You’re out there in the (very critical) public eye. You’re not afraid to speak your mind. What keeps you Fearless?I have lots of fears, worries and anxieties. “Courage is feeling the fear and doing it anyway.” - Oprah Winfrey. I come back to this quote often. Faith is what allows me to push through my fear. When we hosted Great Expectations, there were some long, tough days but you didn’t panic or complain. Your secret?I panic before every performance. If I am not worried, then I know something is off. It means I am not invested. Doing a show like Great Expectations, I was always aware of the presence of guests who needed to be made to feel comfortable. For many of them, it was their first time on TV. Putting them at ease became my priority. What makes you Fearful right now?I’m afraid for our country in a way I have never been before. This last year has really been a rollercoaster - facing the unknown and waves of change. I worry about my kids. I was terrified both times before I gave birth. I worry about being able to take care of my family. How do you use your craft to overcome or express your Fears?Making art is the process of turning the unknown into something tangible. Every single time you face a blank page or the stage, you are walking into the unknown. But doing it over and over has taught me that fear can be transmuted into other emotions. It does not have to be permanent. Knowing this strengthens my faith. In telling the story of Saartjie Baartma, what did “getting to know “Saartjie teach you about strength, courage and survival?Saartjie Baartman’s story taught me how gruelling the experiences of our ancestors were but they were able to survive. We don’t talk enough about the fact that chattel slavery existed in the Cape for two centuries. We don’t talk about the many people who fought against it, who were willing to die for their freedom. Saartjie was silenced, but I am not. I can be abused and misunderstood, lied about and hated, but I still have a voice. Many of our ancestors did not. Having a voice, the ability to speak one’s truth, is a precious gift. What are the most important lessons we should be teaching our children so they can be the best versions of themselves?My Mom taught me to travel and not be afraid of exploring new places. She taught me that I can be multi-faceted. When we were growing up, she was studying, working, as well as participating in activism, and raising us all at the same time. She taught me that it’s okay to leave a relationship that isn’t working. She often stood against societal norms and while it wasn’t easy for her, it instilled in me the desire to stay true to myself even when it was difficult. What advice do you have for someone about to accomplish a fearless 1st?I don’t think fear makes you weak. Fear exposes where we feel vulnerable. The remedy for fear is faith and love. When you practice overcoming fear, you learn that fear does not have to be a permanent state. Fear can shift into other kinds of feelings, and that experience is exhilarating. The gift of overcoming fear is strengthening one’s courage. Courage is a muscle. It can be built, but courage also sits side by side with fear. That gives me great comfort: knowing that the most vulnerable parts of me and the bravest parts of me sit side by side."

        "content": "Many of us have a dream job or a passion we would like to follow but find ourselves trapped in careers to pay the bills. It takes a certain amount of fearlessness to throw in the towel and follow that dream – which is why most of us just don’t do it! Estelle Meldau took the leap and together with her husband Nicholas, took her love for animals to the next level. They closed the door on a very successful recruitment business and put their heart and soul into opening Woodrock Animal Rescue. Estelle tells news anchor and journalist Uveka Rangappa how she Fearlessly followed her passion… Your story is one of Fearlessly risking it all for your passion – animals! When did you realise this was your “calling”? From an early age, animals were my sole passion and formed some of my earliest and most treasured memories. Of course, I had to find someone who understood and shared my passion and fortunately that person moved next door to me when I was 12 years old. I was fortunate to find not only a soulmate in Nicholas but someone who appreciated, supported and encouraged me. What was the moment you made that decision?  It was the life- changing moment when I was told I had Cancer. It was a wakeup call and from that moment on, rescue became my life. I was fortunate to beat Cancer and I can most definitely say animals are wonderful therapists providing uncompromising love and support! What were the challenges getting started?  We had to find suitable land and raise money to construct a shelter which would meet the high standards of health, safety as well as have longevity as this was our entire future. Anyone who has built a home from the ground up will tell you it always takes much longer and costs more than initially forecast. So, we had to be flexible and roll with the punches. Many people prioritise helping humans before animals. That must make your job harder. Truer word never spoken. For that reason, I will continue to speak out for those that can’t. I am known in the rescue world as having a bulldog approach. They say I bark too loudly. Well to that I say “woof woof!”  How are you getting by in these especially difficult times? Worldwide issues have compounded the need for more resources, hands and homes but we stay focused on helping our furry friends. We find ourselves helping many humans too. Gandhi said it best: “The greatness of a nation can be judged by how it treats its weakest members.” You made a brave move. What’s your advice to women who are afraid to change their circumstances for many reasons, one of which might be financial security? I am a very positive person and try and encourage those I meet to pursue what fires up their soul. But I have also been criticised for wearing rose-tinted glasses. As women we have the power to create and recreate ourselves because we play so many different roles. I would always advise a solid plan of action with a step by step strategy and (unlike myself) a plan B! If anything, the world has shown us since Covid-19 and the unrest, that life is short and can change very quickly, so focus on making the change that is important to you and block out the naysayers. What advice do you have for someone about to accomplish a fearless 1st? Fear is only a temporary state and it takes great courage to overcome adversity. As someone who lives very much in the moment, I have regretted my impulsivity but I have never regretted my choice. Am I too emotional, at times yes. Have I always made the best decisions- no but I am fearless when it comes to speaking for those who cannot and it is liberating to know that my insecurities and apprehensions have always been short- lived because to live fearlessly requires heart and that I have in surplus and this is what keeps me fired up to continue at Woodrock!"

Want to build new habits and actually sustain them?  Want to manage your inner critic, free of anxiety and fear?  Lori has the answers. Last week we discussed celebrating your win and aiming for progress.  If you haven’t read this blog post, you can do so here.  Today, we’ll list some more tools needed to show up to yourself in life and business.  Starting with:  Don’t wait to feel like it  When it comes to a new goal/habit/hobby, there is a story you have told yourself that you need to feel like doing it to take action. Here’s the truth – you will never feel like doing it. You cannot wait for this magic burst of inspiration and motivation to do the activity you scheduled for yourself.Have you ever heard of having ‘Runners Block’? There’s a reason for that. They get onto the road whether they feel like it or not and just run. How do you move through this barrier?Make the decision the night before and allow no room for debate. In this way, you will not need to rely on willpower or motivation. Benjamin Hardy, author of Willpower Doesn’t Work: Discover the Hidden Keys to Success says:  ‘To be frank, willpower is for people who haven’t decided what they actually want in their lives. If you’re required to exert willpower to do something, there is an obvious internal conflict. You want to eat the cookie, but you also want be healthy. You want to focus at work, but you also want to watch that YouTube video. You want to be present with your kids, but you can’t stop looking at your phone. You don’t know what you want and are thus internally conflicted. Your desire (your why) for your goals isn’t strong enough. You aren’t invested in yourself and your dreams.’ Marketing Guru, Joe Polish, says he does 50 burpees a day. He claims that he hates doing them, but he loves the feeling of having done 50 burpees a day. How about reframing your mindset to how you will feel after having achieved the micro win? The problem with waiting to feel like it is that ultimately you will land up avoiding the task and breaking the agreement with yourself because you weren’t ‘feeling inspired or creative or energised’ that day. This causes havoc on your confidence and self-esteem and catapults you into a downward spiral for the day resulting in procrastination and choices that are not in your own best interest.    2. USE FEAR AS A COMPASS A huge barrier to taking action and showing up to ourselves is fear. It could be the fear of failure, fear of not being good enough or the fear of not being perfect that prevents us from taking action on what matters most to us. Your brain is hard-wired for protection, but there aren’t any Sabretooth tigers anymore – it’s protecting you from the feeling of discomfort that comes with doing something new and moving out of your comfort zone.You like the known even if it’s not always best for you. This is the reason why you may be holding onto old habits, thoughts and patterns that no longer serve you.When you are forming these new neural pathways, the new way of doing things, there will inevitably be feelings of anxiety and uneasiness.Have you ever used Waze or Google Maps to take you somewhere new, and there’s this reflex not to want to trust the technology? Like you know better? But you have no choice other than to trust this different route than you would usually take, and you land up discovering a better route, which ultimately becomes your new normal. Similarly, you need to trust yourself to discover the new route – this new way of being - until it becomes your new normal. For example, suppose you are training yourself to wake up 30 minutes earlier. In that case, it’s going to be uncomfortable at first but eventually, when you do it for long enough, your body adjusts, and it becomes the new body clock. Fear is a compass, and you need to run towards it. If you think about something you did for the first time like presenting to your team, it was daunting, but you did it. I’m sure you had the same initial feelings of angst, but in time you mastered it. When it comes to creating new actions, remind yourself that it’s another one of those.Next week, we’ll discuss more ways in which you can show up to yourself in life &amp; business. Until then remember, of you genuinely want to let go of the old version of yourself, you need to ask yourself some tough questions: Am I willing to go through the discomfort of doing things differently?Am I willing to let go of old destructive or out of date habits and thoughts that no longer serve me?"

Last week we discussed not waiting to feel like it and using fear as a compass.  If you haven’t read this blog post, you can do so here. In our final blog post on how to show up to yourself in life and business, we discuss: giving yourself permission “You pile up enough tomorrows, and you’ll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays.”- Meredith Willson Lori always wanted to write a book, but she had no idea where to begin. She reached out to a well-known journalist she had worked with for some advice as she had published several books successfully. They met for coffee, and she shared her experience on how Lori could get started. Lori also asked her what voice recorder she uses for her interviews because she knew she wanted to incorporate stories and insights from leading South African women. Lori left this meeting elated and felt so inspired to get going on the project. However, she convinced herself that she could not possibly begin until this recorder arrives. Three weeks go by, and it finally reaches Lori’s front door. Lori takes the package inside, unwraps it and stares at it for a while. She then slips it very gently into a drawer and invents the next reason why she can’t possibly start writing this book. In that moment, Lori realised three powerful things: Her excuses meant her fear was winningNo one was coming to give her permission to beginFundamentally, she had not given herself permission to call herself a writer or shift her identity to the kind of person who can do things like this. What is your recorder equivalent? Don’t tell yourself you need to read a stack of books or get a piece of paper to permit you to take action on your dreams. Beware of telling yourself you need a partner to give you a false sense of security. Don’t let the fear win.  Give yourself permission to start even if you have no idea what the result is going to be.All you can do is show up and act despite the fear and self-doubt. In conclusion, choose one area of your life and commit to one new habit or goal in your personal and professional life. It could be a hobby or learning the skill of public speaking. Remind yourself of the steps forward: Let go of perfectionFocus on the process, not the outcomeCelebrate your winAim for progressDon’t wait to feel like itUse fear as your compassGive yourself permission Each micro win not only gets results but also teaches you something far more critical: to trust yourself.  The ultimate skill is the habit of showing up consistently and keeping the promises you make to yourself. This develops true self-confidence and resilience, and it is with these tools, you are unstoppable."

        "content": "Over the past few weeks, I’ve had the honour and privilege of talking to some incredible women about what it means to be Fearless. Their stories have been ones of amazing courage, unspeakable struggles and absolute resilience. Not only did their stories lead me to wonder if I’ve ever been Fearless, but they led me to actually take a long, hard look at my own life right now and make one of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever had to make. After 25 years of being in news, both radio and television, I’ve decided to venture into unknown territory! I have resigned from my job as a TV news anchor and will be joining a media company as a programme and content manager. I have given up the only role I have ever known and comfortable financial security to do what really makes me happy…talking about everyday life issues and helping others navigate this difficult world! I’m no stranger to fear though.  Like right now I am hiding out in my bedroom, writing this because I’ve just accidentally closed the garage door on my husband’s car, wondering if I should be packing a suitcase for a quick getaway! Lol! But seriously, my first recollection of fear was as a child when I was terribly afraid of the dark.  As a teenager I was afraid of failing at everything – failing Math and Science, failing my teachers, failing my parents, failing myself! You see, I had excelled at everything from the day I set foot in a classroom, topping the grade every single year until I got to grade 10 and I just didn’t want to do it anymore. I became afraid to try in case I failed. But I pulled through and made it to a Journalism diploma – all the while still afraid I was never going to be good enough. But obviously others, mostly my female bosses, saw in me what I didn’t see in myself and gave me the breaks I needed. That gave me the confidence to excel. My first Fearless experience as an adult was when I left my parents’ home in the small town of Verulam and headed for the big city of Johannesburg in my mid-20s in 2002. I was going to really be a “grownup” for the first time, and I was terrified! But I’m the kind of person who has never let fear stop me from doing anything! I just dive right in and say, “what will be, will be” and face the consequences afterwards! And that has served me well because being a journalist doesn’t mean you’re not fearful of certain situations, it means you are able to put aside those fears and get the job done for the greater good. And that is what I did in the decades that followed, covering news and doing shows like Great Expectations. There were protest marches, trips to post war Iraq complete with unauthorised landings in Baghdad and facing snipers past curfew, talking to dangerous gangsters on street corners, skydiving, riding bikes and doing donuts in fast cars to show the world that moms aren’t boring. Experiences like that show you that you can be Fearless, but they don’t mean you’ll never be afraid of anything ever again.  Being married and having kids means being afraid every day of not being good enough, not taking good enough care of your family. Being on air, in front of cameras also comes with a certain amount of fear regardless of how long you’ve been doing it. Do you have the right energy, are you asking the right questions, what will the viewer numbers show? I’ve had to grow a pretty thick skin over the years, but I’ve still had to take the criticism on the chin and do it all over again the next day.And now as I venture into a new world, I know I have done the right thing, at the right time and for the right reasons. And “knowing” and “trusting” myself has made me absolutely Fearless.PS: My husband’s car survived the “garage door attack” with minimal damage, as did my marriage! My husband forgave me after an excruciating hour of the silent treatment."

        "content": "Actress Laura Kelly has survived more than her fair share of health scares – from the time she was born. Yet she went on to begin her acting career at a very early age. Laura was just 4 years old when she got her TV break on the iconic children’s show  Pumpkin Patch! She went on to make a name for herself in television, radio and business – and is now forging ahead while living with Bipolar Disorder. Laura tells media personality Uveka Rangappa all about fearlessly “getting on with it” after facing near death… You started acting about 20 years ago - that must surely come with many Fearless 1sts … My first fearful moment was around the age of 11 or 12.  I was auditioning for a place at The National School of the Arts in Johannesburg. I had to present a monologue and a song. I was very nervous and scared because I really wanted it. I beat that fear by making sure I was prepared AND being myself, being authentic. You were quite ill from birth and had many scares since then including something very serious about 12 years ago – tell us about that? I was born with a hole in my heart and had open heart surgery before high school. I\"ve had a virus in my brain called encephalitis, had my jaw broken in 3 places during an attempted hijacking &amp; I\"ve survived a cerebral aneurysm which I consider a miracle. Surviving a cerebral aneurysm is indeed miraculous.  I definitely thought I was dying. Probably because I was! Were it not for the very quick reaction of the people I was with when the vessel in my brain burst, I doubt I would have made it. There was a montage of my life playing in my head, thoughts of my mother, father and sister and then what felt like a calling on the other end, drawing me in.  I remember doctors trying to get me back, telling me to hold on because my mother was on her way. A mother’s presence is so incredibly strong, everything changed once she arrived. How did that affect your career? I feel all the time I spent recovering put me about 10 years behind my peers. While I’ve done many things quite successfully, I still can\"t help but wonder where I\"d be had I not had those experiences to overcome.           How did the passing of your mom Sylvia in 2010 lead to your Bipolar disorder diagnosis? Before my mom’s death I\"d been diagnosed with Depression. Diagnosing a Bipolar patient with Depression is a common mistake. My mother’s passing was the trigger for my Bipolar diagnosis, it was most certainly a fearful moment. What followed felt like a four year manic period - a combination of ups and downs that just seemed endless. How did it affect your daily functioning? Everything changed. It took a miserably long time to find the right medication and in the meantime the side effects caused everything from rapid weight gain to memory loss, which impacted my career, my income, my self-esteem and my relationships.          You’re getting back into acting – how challenging is it? It\"s hard to remember that you\"re good at something when you struggle to trust your own emotions. I live in my head a lot as a symptom of having Bipolar and being medicated. It’s difficult to trust and believe in myself and not expect that people are going to judge or mistreat me.  As a performer, you need to be able to take constructive criticism and believe in yourself enough to deliver. The very nature of Bipolar fights against these things. What’s your advice to other women who have been hit by illness and tragedy to keep going? Tell someone, speak honestly about how you feel. Ask for help and accept it. Take it one day at a time and never assume that it\"s payback for something terrible you\"ve done. I always ask myself, “How can I learn from this experience? How have I grown from this experience?” This brings purpose and meaning to the difficulties I\"ve faced."

        "content": "As a camera operator for news channel eNCA, Moleboge “Lebo” Kobola, has found herself in some scary situations. But none of those could prepare her for the news she received in May 2020. More than a year after first finding a lump in her breast, Lebo finally had it checked out. She was told she had stage 2 Breast Cancer - she had just turned 31.  Lebo had the lump removed and underwent Chemotherapy. A few months later in October, she made the brave decision to reveal her Breast Cancer diagnosis live on the Health Focus on eNCA with Uveka Rangappa. Lebo\"s colleagues had no idea what she\"d been battling. A year later, Lebo talks to Uveka again about how she Fearlessly battled Breast Cancer. As a camera operator, you’re often thrown into precarious situations. If you had to look back on your 1st Fearless moment, what would it be? In my line of work I encounter a lot of heart wrenching situations but the one that got to me the most was a story at Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital. We had to capture visuals of people with severe injuries during the festive season.  I saw people who’d lost body parts and some so badly hurt they were on life support. One of the doctors showed us patients who were literally brain dead and they were waiting for the families’ permission to take them off the machines.  I still smell the blood and medication in the ward. But I had to put my feelings aside and just do my job. I could have easily neglected the story, but I stuck to it and produced a piece that touched many South Africans. What was the most difficult part of your breast cancer journey - waiting for the diagnosis, the treatment or going public with it when you spoke to me about it live on air during the health show? Every stage had its own challenges, but I think the most difficult times were when I was given the diagnosis and having to detail my experience to you live on TV. My results were given to me telephonically since it was COVID and lockdown. I just could not handle the news and I broke down for days. What were the emotions that ran through you when you heard the diagnosis? I was in disbelief and I asked myself questions like “why me”. I actually thought they had made a mistake as I’d always believed such diseases only affected older people. How has breast cancer changed your life? Physically, cancer has changed my appearance in some ways.  After the lump was removed from one of my breasts, I had to have reconstructive surgery to align them. Chemotherapy caused me to lose my hair. I gained weight, which was very different compared to other patients.  I also have to take medication that puts me on controlled menopause. I have to pay more attention to my wellbeing and diet. What has it taught you about YOU? I now appreciate a lot of things about life as I don’t push myself beyond my capabilities.  I am taking life as it comes.  Has it made you Fearless or more Fearful? Cancer made me Fearless. It made me realise I can achieve whatever I put my mind to. Many people might see Breast Cancer as a death sentence but you stay positive - what is your advice to them? Firstly accept the situation. Seek emotional support from groups of people who are going through the same thing, and your family and friends. Pray or meditate to calm your emotions, stay positive, don’t be hard on yourself, Take all the advice from your Oncology team, ensure that medication is taken as prescribed, be patient as it can take years for you to stabilise and before you know it, it’ll be behind you.

        "content": "Joburg born Thati Pele is a statistician turned film director. For Thati, taking that leap was certainly the right decision. After studying filmmaking in the US, she has a string of awards under her director’s belt. Now back in Johannesburg, Thati directs commercials and streaming shows for Netflix. It was on one of those sets that she met media personality Uveka Rangappa. Thati tells Uveka all about her Fearless journey from number cruncher to the director’s chair…You’ve already accomplished so much in a very challenging, competitive industry.  What would you say was your first Fearless moment?I had to make a decision to leave my 9-5 job where I was moving up the corporate ladder pretty quickly OR accept a tiny scholarship to study an amazing masters in filmmaking at New York University.  I had never been there, I knew no one and still had to find a way to raise the bulk of my tuition and living expenses in US dollars. Pretty scary but I just did it!A statistician turned film director – how did that happen?Way before my corporate job and New York – I had just completed a Business Science degree at UCT and landed a great job. Instead of taking it, I decided to take a gap year in South Korea and teach English to pay back my student loans.On a day off, I was walking around an art village called Heyri when a producer stopped me and asked if I wanted to play a nun in a vampire movie.  I thought “Nope”, but my Korean friends insisted that I at least go and see what it was about. So, a few days later we went, armed with pepper spray!Well, it turns out the vampire movie was helmed by one of the best “original old school” directors in the world. It went on to win at Cannes and years later the lead actor starred in Parasite. I accepted the role as ‘nun number 1’, but I also asked to shadow the director for a few days. I was instantly bitten by the cinema bug and he advised that I apply to the world’s best universities to study. I did and he gave me a letter of recommendation. Thanks ‘Bakjwi’ What’s it been like for you as a young Black woman in this industry – especially on the international platform?There’ve been some very real barriers to entry. My return from New York was bumpy while I was finding my feet, but I had great support. It’s had its ups and downs but overall, it’s been “dope”!I’ve worked with you and you’re just amazing. The way you handle difficult situations with such ease. How do you do it?Firstly, thank you for the wonderful compliment…I love my job, so I receive it! I think it’s a combination of me and my education. I’ve watched so many very accomplished directors in action. All the great ones are cool under extreme pressure because they know that by the time, they get to set the hard work is done.  If you’ve done your work as a director then you have to trust your actors and the team that you’ve hired to be able to do theirs. Good sets make great films and micromanaging is so 90s. Working with actors must be “complicated”. While some are easy, I’m sure you’ve had your fair share of divas…how do you handle that?The best description I’ve heard of a director is from Guillermo Del Toro to paraphrase: ‘sometimes you act as psychologist, sometimes you are a parent, sometimes you have to set firm boundaries, sometimes you are empathetic’. Always be honest, people know when you are full of BS. My role is to ensure actors can come to work, leave their problems at the door and focus on their craft. I tailor my response for the situation and from person to person.Go on tell us the truth – you must have been tempted at times to just light someone badly or make that camera add 10kgs?Lol, no. The cinematographers I work with don’t play that gameWhat did you set out to do with filmmaking and are you achieving that?To tell our stories with as much joy and authenticity as possible. I always wanted to see versions of myself in the films and TV shows I watched growing up. Bold characters, people of colour who are nuanced, intelligent, curious, rabble rouser, explorers capable of great mirth. I’m very fortunate that I’ve had the honour of working with incredible creatives who feel the same. So far so good.What’s the endgame for Thati?Space…the final frontier.Thati Pele is currently in development of her first feature film, the dark comedy drama ‘Brace Yourself’ which was invited at the 2021 Locarno Directors Lab in Switzerland."

Sheena runs a family medical practice in Johannesburg and teaches 5th year medical students. The mom of two daughters also finds time to run the Geness Foundation and make small talk with the likes of Oprah and Barack Obama. But she’s had her fair share of struggles and heartbreak in recent years. Sheena tells media personality Uveka Rangappa about being Fearless in the face of illness and grief.You deal with sickness every day, have suffered your own health scares and the loss of your Mum last year. What would you say was your 1st Fearless moment?It was when I had to give my dying mother, who was in the ICU with Covid19, the permission to close her eyes and let go of her life. Before that, I was adamant she fight the battle and be strong. Being a doctor, I am used to fixing people, and in this moment of letting her go, I literally had to use every bit of strength I had leftWhat did it take to overcome that?It honestly took the sight of her pain and suffering, and the realisation that this wasn’t a problem I could fix or heal.How did you deal with your own health issues these past few years?  Living with chronic lung disease and tumours growing all over my body has certainly taken a toll on the quality of my life. It has taken the courage to face impending death, that has finally given my mind a break. This has culminated in a form of healing, mindfulness and living in the presentYou grew up working in fashion, you were a model – you could easily have opted for a life of glamour yet you ended up a medical doctor – why that path?I always knew that I was going to be a healer, even from the tender age of 12, and I put all my effort into a medical career. I enjoyed modelling; it gave me pocket money and great work experience. Even after I qualified as a doctor, I still modelled for various charity events and campaigns.  I’ve learnt to enjoy the best of both worlds, but the reason I get up every day is to don that white coat! It is my first passionYou’re busy with patients every day, yet you still find time for philanthropy through your foundation – which causes are close to your heart?The Geness foundation has helped thousands of South Africans in education, entrepreneurship, sport and health but I hold a special place in my heart for the bursary recipients. It is most endearing to witness these young women grow, knowing that I have made an impact on their futures. As they say: You educate a girl, you educate a village!What do you tell your daughters about living their best lives?I want passion to be the driving force of their aspirations. They need to do what activates them. Not everyone is going to be a doctor, scientist or astronaut. That would be a boring world! We need fashion designers, teachers, artisans, etc. so I would like them to follow their dreams, double down their efforts to fulfil them, and trust the process as they grow. You’ve spent time with Oprah and Barack Obama (swoon!). What impression did they leave on you?I have followed Barack Obama’s orations since he was a senator, so to hear that baritone up close and personal was surreal! He emphasised his work in his foundation and shared notes about philanthropic work which reiterated its relevance in my life. Oprah has a “sage-like” presence and has left an indelible mark as my mentor. Through her wisdom I have made peace with my extraordinary life and embraced the value of my experiences. You seem to be a woman who has everything – what keeps you awake at night?I started studying again, so I lie awake thinking about upcoming exams. I’m gripped by the fear and anxiety of being a student at this ripe age. What do you most want to be remembered for?I would love to be remembered by my patients as a doctor who has had a holistic impact on their lives. It would be a great honour to leave behind a legacy of aspiration to all the beneficiaries of the Geness Foundation. Finally, I hope my daughters will remember me for my work ethic and caring nature.

        "content": "As we mark another 16 Days of Activism against Gender Based Violence, we’re bombarded with awareness campaigns and often empty promises by those meant to protect our most vulnerable. It’s at times like these that we need to salute the real heroes who tirelessly and fearlessly fight the good fight to keep the innocent among us safe and to get justice for those who have survived the unimaginable. Miranda Jordan-Friedmann, founder of Women and Men Against Child Abuse (WMACA) has dedicated her life to helping and healing survivors of abuse despite facing challenges of her own. Miranda talks to media personality Uveka Rangappa about how she has Fearlessly fought against GBV for 27 years 1. As the Founder of WMACA and having dealt over the years with abuse and sexual offences involving children, including your own personal experience, what would you say was your first Fearless moment?  My parents’ divorce when I was little was my first moment of fear. One moment I was secure and then my life changed.  I realised the impact when I became a mother myself. As a child  I was never given a voice during that  divorce and decisions were made for me. After monitoring various cases in the media, I called the Child Protection Unit who linked me with a group of women who’d experienced similar vulnerabilities or even abuse and we started the first Pressure/Lobby organisation called The Child Abuse Action group in 1994. A lot of my work especially when I formed Women and Men Against Child abuse and the Kidz Clinics helped me heal from the hurt, fear and helplessness that resulted from my parents’ divorce. 2. How did it evolve into your  life’s work?   When I started, I really didn’t realise just how prevalent abuse was - in particular sexual abuse of children - and also how archaic our laws were. But we were lucky to have a lot of media support for so many of our campaigns to address this and put the spotlight on various aspects of our criminal justice process as well as new protocols for child protection. As a result, things started to change as Government felt the pressure and started taking the subject of abuse seriously. 3. It’s “heavy“work. Do you ever feel overwhelmed or hopeless? There are days when it all feels never ending and I start to feel like it’s time to get out, so I go to the bush or ride my horse. Often just being with my horse is enough or with my dogs in the garden just feeds my soul. I am very blessed with a wonderful family, my daughter, sister, and close friends who support me.  4. You’ve no doubt dealt with hundreds of cases over the past 27 years. Are there any cases in particular that affected you?  One was a little girl called Samantha who was raped repeatedly in Hillbrow. Her mother and father left her with friends, one of whom was a prostitute who in turn left the child with her partner who raped her at the age of five and also deprived her of food and water. It took years for her to stop drinking water from the toilet bowel even when she was taken to a place of safety. It took almost two years to get a sentence of 18 years and involved lots of campaigning around public reporting of such cases. I mean there was no way people in the flat did not notice a child being abused - with one arm broken and the other fractured. Then there was Lerato, a six-year-old girl who was abducted by a family friend, raped near the pylons in Alexandra and left for dead.  After seeing her in hospital, I began a 16-year relationship guiding her into adulthood and making sure her attacker Ruben Modiba served a life sentence.  I started the Kidz Clinic in Alexandra in honour of Lerato being so courageous. What also stands out are the two cases of child abuse brought by survivors who are now adults - one of which challenged the law and set new precedent. These were the Bob Hewitt and Sidney Frankel cases because these were well respected, well known men who destroyed so many lives - we will never know quite how many. For me I want every person who thinks of abusing a child to know that WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IT TAKES TO GET YOU – NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES!  5. How do you cope with all the emotions that come with this kind of work? Anger is a great motivator to do things and be active. The sadness and desperation are far more difficult, but I know things are slowly getting better – children are speaking out more than ever before including male children and that gives me hope. That’s the reason I can carry on! "

        "content": "While the country is urged to sit up and take action against Gender Based Violence for a mere 16 Days every year, there are those who have made it their life’s mission to protect our women and children every single day! Dr Shaheda Omar is one such warrior. She is the Director of the Teddy Bear Foundation and has been with its clinic for Abused Children for over 20 years.  She is President of The South African Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (SAPSAC) and a representative of the Children’s sector – giving a voice to the voiceless. She has assisted in some extremely controversial cases – not only of adults sexually abusing children but where children abuse children. Dr Omar speaks to media personality and fellow SAPSAC member, Uveka Rangappa, about what it takes to get the job done…Growing up in the midst of apartheid, being educated by someone like the great activist Ahmed Timol then dedicating your life to protecting children, you must have had many Fearless moments. Tell us about your 1st Fearless moment?So, it was both a fearful and fearless moment when we attended the funeral of the great activist Ahmed Timol.  There was a strong police presence by the security branch who were ruthless.  Despite their presence, we continued to remain present but also participated in silent protests.Helping and healing children who’ve survived sexual violence must be daunting and heart breaking. What led you here?I always wanted to be a healer of some sort.  My ambition was to pursue a career in medical health which didn’t happen.  This then propelled me into a career where I could work on healing people.  I worked with the aged, people with substance abuse problems and then child abuse during the course of my Masters in Health.  I felt drawn to working with families of incest - particularly the children who were violated and helpless in these situations. It obviously takes a lot of compassion and empathy. How do you NOT get too emotionally involved in your cases?I DO get emotional, but it is a matter of separating myself from the trauma.  It’s very difficult not to want to rescue everyone.  I receive regular debriefing and clinical supervision to support me, process my emotions and ensure that I do not blur the boundaries.  I also look at self-preservation and constructive outlets to allow me to ensure a clear and healthy distance such as prayer, music, meditation, reading and exercise.Every case is devastating but are there any that particularly stand out for you?Yes, most definitely! There was a case of a 5 year old who had witnessed her mother bludgeoned to death by her father.  This child became fearful, lost her speech and became aggressive towards others.  She even used a scissor to re-enact the trauma she had witnessed.  There are many other painful memories of children who have been violated sexually, physically and emotionally.How do you even begin to get near a child who must be so filled with fear?It is not easy for children to trust again after they have been violated so the most important step is to start with where the child is and not force them to participate or engage. Trust building is a process like healing, and you need to allow the child to feel safe. Actions are stronger than words.What are your ongoing frustrations and challenges?When systems fail our children! Where perpetrators get off scot free or receive lenient sentences for atrocious crimes committed against the most vulnerable and weak i.e. children. During the 16 days campaign, we hear a lot of promises by government AND ordinary South Africans to step up the fight. Have you seen any change in recent years?GBVF has become recognised as a national pandemic by the President so this is one step forward but victims continue to suffer and even die daily.  It’s clear that the implementation is still problematic and more active and stringent measures are needed to deter potential offenders. Child protection is everybody’s business.  We cannot be seen to collude or sit in silence. We need to uphold the rights of each and every child.  We need to make the protection of children YOUR business, MY business OUR business! "

        "content": "There are many people who do amazing work to help survivors of Gender Based Violence – and every one of them is vital. But when the decision has been made to stop the cycle of abuse – the correct legal advice is imperative.How many times have we heard stories about women or children who’ve been brave enough to speak out, but have been let down by the justice system? This is where non-profit organisations like Lawyers Against Abuse (LvA) come into play, providing both legal services and therapy for victims.  The 1st for Women Foundation has supported Lawyers Against Abuse since 2019.It’s thanks to the Fearless commitment of attorneys such as Rethabile Mosese – a survivor herself - that they’re able to do the work they do. Rethabile tells media personality Uveka Rangappa what it’s like making the law work for survivors of GBV…Fighting for justice for victims of GBV, helping them through their own fears must be heartbreaking. What would you say was YOUR 1st Fearless moment?It was earlier this year when I publicly shared my own experiences with gender-based violence. Seeing how everyone in the room held space for me is what helped me overcome the shame and stigma - that it was not my fault and I am not defined by what happened. And that being a survivor does not take away from what I do, that it is possible to carry this history and be a good lawyer. I’m also inspired by my grandmother whose painful story I must acknowledge. She was orphaned, married off at a young age, deprived of education or gainful employment, a young widow left to raise eight children during Apartheid South Africa. “Herstory” represents resilience and the human spirit’s potential for overcoming challenges.Do you draw on this experience in your work?The wound is the place where light enters and though my grandmother has transitioned to the ancestral realm, she continues to live through me. She reminds me that we, as women, as Black women, are not always voiceless or powerless. LvA creates space for women to heal themselves. So, I walk with my sisters, bear witness to their testimony, hold the system to account and, together, we turn the courtroom into a space for collective healing.Are you able to tell us about the most difficult case you’ve ever dealt with?Certainly, it was LvA’s first life imprisonment sentence in a criminal case. On 27 April 2017, Mantwa* was brutally attacked and raped by her ex-boyfriend, Joshua*. Mantwa opened a criminal case against Joshua and was referred to LvA for support. Despite strong DNA evidence linking Joshua to the crime, the trial dragged on for over 16 months. Joshua had raped at least four other women in Diepsloot who had either left the area or committed suicide. But, Mantwa and her friends (who were witnesses) bravely persevered despite ongoing pressure, intimidation and threats from Joshua and other community members. LvA was there for Mantwa through the entire process. Then, on 21 February 2019, Joshua was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. A man who thought he was untouchable, was put behind bars, ending his reign of terror! We’ve often heard about how our system lets victims down. How does that impact your work?The failure of the criminal justice system in cases of GBV creates an environment where perpetrators operate with impunity and are rarely punished for their actions. Despite progressive and victim-centric legislation, victims rarely see justice due to severe deficiencies in implementation by state actors who fail to provide them with the protection they’re legally entitled to. Survivors also regularly experience secondary victimisation including discrimination by police, victim blaming, and the often traumatic and adversarial courtroom environment. Looking at the brutality of so many attacks, what do you think makes the perpetrators of these heinous crimes so inhumane?Children living in violent homes often learn that violent behaviour in a relationship is permissible and acceptable and that when people get angry, bad things happen. What is often underestimated is the potential effect of such exposure on later relationships. LvA runs interventions for ECD learners to foster empathy and compassion for others, increase positive expressions of gender identity and to reduce levels of aggressive and/or violent behaviour among learners. It is important that prevention starts at an early age.This is a job where for every victory there’s another victim – how do you carry on?My dream is to live in a world where LvA services are not needed. Sadly, we have a long way to go.  I understand that I am in it for the long haul and take time to celebrate the small victories - a final protection order issued, a state actor’s changed behaviour towards victims, a community member who holds on to our pamphlet for weeks after a clinic talk and finally comes in for legal assistance, improved partnership and collaboration between civil society actors. All these “small fires” will one day burn down the patriarchy!*NOT THEIR REAL NAMES "

        "content": "The murder of UCT student, Uyinene Mrwetyana, in August 2019 by post office worker Luyanda Botha was yet another heinous crime that left South Africans in disbelief. Even though the country was outraged and Botha was given three life sentences for raping, strangling and bludgeoning 19 year old Uyinene to death, very little has changed to protect our women and children from predators like him. But it’s thanks to activists like Masimbulele Buso, counselling psychologist and Managing Director of the Uyinene Mrwetyana Foundation that the fight against Gender Based Violence goes on. Masimbulele tells media personality Uveka Rangappa how they  work every day to make sure Uyinene did not die in vain..  It takes a really strong person to do what you do which is look after the wellbeing and calm the fears of our youth, in particular young women, in these dangerous and unpredictable times. But what was YOUR 1st Fearless moment? My first Fearless moment was when I left my parent’s house for university. For the first time, I was confronted by the realities of the world, especially as a woman. It was the first time I felt unsafe. For the rest of my adulthood, like majority of women living in South Africa, I have had to unconsciously navigate life in fear.  I overcome this fear by immersing myself in the GBV space and making a difference in the communities I come from. How does your work at the Foundation ensure that Uyinene didn’t die in vain? It was important to us that we turn this tragedy into something positive and healing. The Uyinene Mrwetyana Foundation was founded in celebration of the life of Uyinene. The family wanted to continue her legacy and the fight against GBV. Our mandate is to promote her lifelong vision of fighting all forms of injustice against women. Our vision is to see a society that is free of gender- based violence. The existence of the foundation is also a form of resistance, a form of activism and a civic movement. We refuse to lose hope! What are the stories our young women and men are telling you?We hear many different stories – especially stories of survival. Often, people are looking for a safe space to share. We also come across women who want to leave an  abusive relationship.. In these cases, we assist them with exit plans that include emergency contact numbers,  available shelters, relatives and friends who can help. What do you tell young people about not letting fear take over their lives but at the same time keeping themselves safe?  I think a lot of women in South Africa see themselves as the “1 in 3 women” statistic. There\"s nothing we can do to allay their fear because from childhood, we are taught that the world is a dangerous place. However, we try and equip women with tools to navigate society. We also focus on working with men to take responsibility for the privilege that patriarchy allows them. We want more male-centred interventions, where men can talk to each other and lead conversations that are focused on unlearning norms, beliefs , and attitudes that contribute to the oppression of women. The crimes against women and children seem to be getting more “angry” and violent. What is this telling us about society? The increase in violent crimes against women communicates firstly that our society is built on patriarchy that continues to oppress women, and GBV is used a a tool to perpetuate and continue patriarchy. The more we challenge patriarchy the more violent and heinous these crimes seem to be. Secondly, our political history has taught us to use violence as a form of communication and as a form of discipline.  What do you think it will take to see a change or make a difference?  Firstly, our policymakers and decision makers need to put  the necessary policies and laws in place.  As civil society we need to continue challenging the patriarchal norms and beliefs. It is important that we raise children differently. Boy children need to know that there is a different way to be a man, a positive way to be masculine. GBV is a multifaceted issue that requires all role players to have their hands on deck. Our  victory is in our unity. What is Masimbulele Buso’s mission when it comes to GBV? My mission is to educate and develop young people . It is important that we develop youth to be socially responsible leaders in their communities . This will in turn equip them to be the change they want to see.   "

        "content": "As we celebrate the month of love, it’s fascinating to hear how love and passion for something can drive us to overcome huge challenges and realise our dreams. Farzana Alvarado, popularly known as Chef Zana, is a woman of many talents. The mom of two started out as a news anchor and radio presenter but is currently a top chef, culinary consultant, recipe developer and food social media influencer. Chef Zana tells media personality, Uveka Rangappa how she Fearlessly pursued her love for the culinary arts after a life-changing experience.You are so accomplished and have been around the world working with major companies which must have been exciting but at the same time scary. Can you remember your first Fearless moment?The first time I went on radio to read the news live on air, was my scariest moment. I remember standing outside the studio, my hands were shaking and my voice quivered. I will never forget this moment. I calmed myself by praying. It\"s what I always do to keep fear at bay.You’ve also worked for major brands such as Porsche, Virgin Management, The London School of Business, Warner Bros Pictures, and the Disney Channel. What took you down the food route? It was a combination of different experiences. My late grandfather was a cook. I have childhood memories of helping him and marvelled at him cooking in large \"deghs\" over a fire. As a young adult, I became interested in the food of other cultures. Living abroad really opened my eyes to how food connects us all, helps us share cultures and traditions. Each dish tells a story. While in the UK, I worked on the PR campaign for a massive food festival called \"Taste of London\". I got to meet some of the top chefs in the world, and watch them create. I loved the café society culture of Europe, and began to see food, not just as a source of nutrition, but as a creative outlet.But you faced a major challenge before this happened?Many years ago, I was in a car accident which left me with severe injuries including nerve and tendon damage to my left hand, resulting in loss of mobility. I endured years of medical procedures and hundreds of hours of therapy but none of it was successful. I had to dedicate a large chunk of my life learning to do without it, both physically and emotionally. When I enrolled at Culinary School, it was a case of facing this reality full on and figuring out how to overcome it in the best way possible. I remember the moment I told my loved ones I wanted to go to Culinary School, the silence was deafening. It seemed no one wanted to encourage me, but no one wanted to discourage me either. The more difficult it seemed though, the more I became determined to live my dream despite the circumstances and make the \"impossible\" possible!Do your injuries still pose a challenge for you? Sometimes. However, I have learnt to find ways that work for me and be patient with myself. I find that this injury has taught me to work harder, to be extremely focused, and to push myself. More than anything, it reminds and teaches me every day to be grateful and not take my body for granted.Many people might have given up on moving forward after an experience like that – what keeps you going? Reality and faith! It took me almost a year to figure out that I had survived the accident for a purpose. I could either feel sorry for myself and let life pass me by or I could pick myself up by the bootstraps and make my life what I wanted it to be and live my purpose. I chose the latter.What does your new title as South African Chef Brand Ambassador for the World Wildlife Fund South African Sustainable Seafood Initiative mean for you? It\"s an honour to have this title and I have huge respect for what they want to achieve. As Chef Brand Ambassador, I work with some of the most dedicated marine and conservation scientists on public education and campaigns for seafood sustainability, and I create wonderful recipes for SASSI using green listed seafood.What’s next for Chef Zana? I was recently elected to the SA Chefs Association Gauteng Committee and I want to use this platform to shine the spotlight on women in culinary. It\"s a male dominated industry and I do believe we ladies need to be represented more. Apart from that, product development is currently underway, and I\"m working on a cookbook.You can follow Chef Zana on Facebook @ChefZana, Insta"

The OBGYN and sexologist (Dr.Gynae on Instagram) fearlessly broaches topics many of us are too shy to bring up. Dr Zenda tells media personality Uveka Rangappa why we need to make SELF LOVE a priority – starting now in this month of love.Your job as OBGYN and sexologist requires a good deal of caring and responsibility with many touch and go moments as well. What was your 1st Fearless moment?My 1st fearless moments were both the first day at medical school and as a doctor. I knew I was stepping into a “bigger than self “destiny, I was excited and pretty nervous at the same time.You have to give a lot of yourself – how does your personal life journey influence your work?I best describe myself as “a patient who became a physician.” Empathy and kindness towards my fellow women are some of my superpowers. I bring all of me, my pink heels, my science, my laughter, my PMS, my tears, my stories, I bring all of my love for myself and my work, I show up as the most authentic ME, in the hope of giving every woman a safe space to be their FEARLESS SELVES!What’s the most fulfilling part of your work?Being free to live out my dreams, journeying with amazing women from across the country /continent and being part of the miracle of bringing new life into the world, gets me every timeIt’s not always good news that you have to impart to your patients – how do you deal with that?My work reminds me that people remember how you made them feel at their most vulnerable times.  Being able to sit in, hold space and being transparent is paramount to me. In turn, I proactively go to therapy regularly, so I can debrief and offload for my own mental wellbeing. Are you ever criticized for the information you disseminate on social media? More challenged, than criticized. The deep patriarchal beliefs we’ve grown up with will take a while to unlearn and relearn for all of us. But there is also a growing curiosity, a welcoming of a better way of doing things. Our beliefs and socio-cultural norms will never move us forward as a people, for as long as they liberate some and oppress others.Self- love is so important but many of us don’t prioritize it. Why is it important that we “give back” to ourselves? Because we can’t give to others what we deny ourselves. We have to know for ourselves first that WE ARE WORTHY OF LOVE.What are some of the common problems that couples and individuals are facing these days?As individuals, particularly in women’s health space, its “understanding and working with ourselves “. Many women still feel uneasy about their bodies, sometimes to a point of shame. For couples it is still “poor communication”. Communication is a skill. It allows us to articulate ourselves, our needs and frustrations, but also gives us opportunities to really hear and understand the next person. We struggle to talk about things like pleasure, infertility, sexual diversity, even to talk to our children about puberty.  We need to create safe spaces for honest conversation.How would we know if we are in “trouble” and need to work on something as individuals or a couple?The reality is relationships will show cracks when one or both parties stop working on themselves. This means bringing our best selves instead of using the relationship as a dumping ground. We are often “in trouble “within ourselves first before it shows up through our relationship. It’s easy to shift blame when difficulties occur. I encourage “align with self-first “. An honest look at how one contributes towards the health of a relationship helps us get to a solution faster. When we are aware, we can get the necessary help.Some advice on self-love during this “month of love”Self-love is the best most fulfilling practice and a gift I believe we ought to give to ourselves! It makes loving effortless! "

        "content": "For many of us, February is the month of love! But with love comes the complications of relationships and intimacy. Women and men are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain healthy, satisfying love and sex lives. Thank goodness for people like Lola Montez owner, Sharon Gordon, who is passionate about helping others enjoy life’s pleasures again. Sharon describes herself as an entrepreneur, activist and Fearless teller of necessary truths. She chatted to media personality, Uveka Rangappa, about her journey from Human Rights Lawyer to the adult industry.You’ve led such a fascinating life.  What would you say was your first Fearless moment? When I was five, I pulled out my own front teeth! But I suppose I would say in my first year at university I was approached by the security police and asked to spy on my fellow students. They knew things about me that meant that someone close to me was passing on information. I said no and kicked them out. That interaction was responsible for awakening my political self.You went from being a human rights lawyer in the 80s, dealing with cases that involve treason and sabotage, to owning a business in the adult industry, helping people with relationships and their sexuality. Why the change?The struggle was over, and I was bored – there was nothing left to prove. I was also going through a divorce and my self-esteem was at an all-time low. I didn’t think that anyone would ever love me or that I’d have sex again so decided to get a sex toy. I had the worst shopping experience and decided that no woman deserved to feel that bad about her sexuality. That’s when Lola Montez was born!You describe yourself as the Fearless teller of necessary truth? Tell us about that.I talk honestly about sex and relationships. It is very hard to tell the truth. I try not to be hurtful but sometimes it has to be said. The truth is particularly important when talking to children. In today’s social media world, trolls love to attack and say awful things because they can hide behind their avatar. They need to be called out – that requires one to be fearless.In the adult industry, what do people come to you for help with and what do you tell them? Shew, how long is a piece of string? Most of the questions arise out of a lack of knowledge of education around sex. Think about it - nobody ever gives you a manual. Many, many questions from men and women are around dysfunction of some sort. If it’s medical, they get referred to a doctor and if the issues are mental often therapy is required. The problem with sex is it is often used as a weapon, is shrouded in guilt and shame and never shrouded in pleasure. Why is it important that we try to “fix things” in the bedroom? Because when you know better you do better, and life is far too short for bad sex. You’re also very involved with Dignity Dreams - how challenging and rewarding is that? I’ve been called Sharon the Salmon – always swimming against convention and this is true for Dignity Dreams. If there is one thing more challenging than talking about sex it’s talking about menstrual blood. I love the education and sustainability of the brand. It has gotten easier over the years, but you can see people thinking ‘please shut up!’ It is not as rewarding as one would imagine but I take the wins when they come.What would you say has made you the Fearless crusader you are? I think I was born this way! I once saw a movie when the character said, “There comes a time in your life when you have to decide what kind of a dog you are?” I am a dog of war and I go to the barriers every single day!What should the world prepare for next from the Fearless Sharon Gordon? Something a little less confrontational – I’m launching a volunteering platform called Volunteer Now. The premise is a platform where NPOs can offer volunteering opportunities and volunteers can find an opportunity that suits their interests. The tag line is ‘Making the World Kinder’. Maybe I won’t have to be swimming upstream on this one. "

        "content": "Minakshi Hira went from being an abused wife to GBV survivor, single mum and entrepreneur! She did what many women battle to find the courage to do. She has twice made brave decisions. The first was getting out of her extremely abusive marriage in 1997 and the second was leaving a secure job to be her own boss in 2019 –  a few years short of turning 50! Minakshi is now an entrepreneur, professional network marketer and all-round inspiration. This mom of two tells Uveka Rangappa how a very special chilli sauce lit a fire under her… 1. You’re an amazing example of starting again. What was your Fearless first?It was the Friday I left home – 3 days after I was brutally beaten by my then husband. I was getting ready to go to work. I remember my ex-mum in law giving me her foundation to cover up my bruises but I couldn’t do anything about the blood clot in my eye. That was the day I decided I needed to change my life. With the help of my colleagues at the SABC and my parents, I was able to get away to a safe place and apply for a restraining order against him. My children were already on holiday at my parents’ home so that helped. 2. How long were you living in that abusive marriage?I lived like this for about 4 years and tried to leave six times. His behaviour changed slowly after I started working at the SABC in 1994.  He would go between being very controlling, insisting that I leave work functions when he said so, to showing up drunk hours later than he was supposed to. It started with verbal abuse, then gambling where he would pick me up from work and head straight to the casino. We would only get home in time for me to get to work the next morning. I barely saw my children on those days. He would also physically abuse me while driving. Things spiralled out of control. I confided in a male friend during this time and we became more than friends.  My husband found out. He said he forgave me but the abuse got worse – even sexually. The last time he took out his gun and shot it in the house into the ceiling. That was my last straw.  It was 31st August 1997 - the day Lady Diana died.3. You’re now an entrepreneur who started your chilli sauce company GURO. Most GBV survivors find it difficult enough to leave let alone the confidence to start again – what drove you?My children! I knew that I had to give them a better life. I am grateful that I came out alive. I had worked hard at various broadcasters including the SABC and eTV.  I travelled, bought my house after being blacklisted for 15 years for debt that was not mine and educated my children on my own. I sold cookware, snacks and food. In July 2019 I started questioning what I really wanted to do and felt that it was time to take a leap of faith and start my own thing.  I resigned from eTV without a clear idea of what I was going to do. I had already registered my company GURO FOODS, the name is a combination of my parents’ nicknames GUppy &amp; ROokie as I wanted to keep their names alive through my business. 4. Was there ever a point where your just wanted to give up?Lockdown in April 2020 was difficult. I found myself contemplating suicide because of my financial situation as I was still sitting with debt that wasn’t mine due to the nature of my marriage.  My current partner encouraged me to start on a menu for GURO FOODS. My first orders came in on the 4th of May 2020.  I delivered food from Springs to Sandton and surrounding areas but it still wasn’t enough – I made a profit of just R350 that month. 5. When was the chilli sauce business born?GURO Sauce came into existence in August 2020 the month of my dad’s death anniversary. I was stressed as my food orders were just trickling in. One night, while sleeping, I heard my dad\"s voice saying “Why don\"t you bottle your sauce Mini”? (his nickname for me). My dad would get me to make this sauce when I was about 12/13 years old and he would sell it for me at work and to his buddies. So after “hearing him” I decided it was the perfect time as it was Women\"s Month and we linked it to giving back to a women abuse organisation. Our aim was to sell 5 000 bottles of sauce and donate R1 to the organisation by the 15th of January 2021 when I turned 50. Unfortunately, we didn’t meet that target but we have sold over a thousand bottles since the launch of the campaign. 6. Some advice for women who are scared to start overStart with what you have and everything else will come to you. Stay strong, never give up on yourself!"

        "content": "Making a fresh start or reinventing yourself can be exciting and scary at the best of times. When you do it under public scrutiny it’s not for the fainthearted, especially if you’re a Beauty Queen! Candice Abrahams became the first and only South African to win Mrs World in 2016 – a title that not only meant a lot for women empowerment but changed her life as a coloured woman who always had to work just a little harder to be seen. Suddenly, she was being seen, judged on her appearance and criticised for it too.  So, for Candice, lockdown was something of a blessing, when she could step out of the limelight. Candice tells Uveka Rangappa how it led to a journey of self-discovery, a fresh start for her mind and body.1. You are so many things – Mrs World, wife, mom, businesswoman to name just a few. All of those things come with a Fearless first. What was your most significant Fearless first?For me it was the moment I decided to put myself first! Pleasing others, putting them first, has always been a major stumbling block to the point of burnout. I’d completely disregard myself, my worth, my value.  I needed to belong, to be liked, to just feel accepted. I was afraid of judgment if I said NO! I faced that during lockdown when I did some serious self-assessment and realised I was not being true to myself.  I extracted myself from what was happening around me and, in a way, isolation was a blessing. It was scary but necessary!2. It’s difficult being thrust into the spotlight and a lot of it means being judged on your appearance – how do you deal with that?For years I could never understand why people seemed intimidated by me, why nobody would approach me just to talk. I thought it might be my appearance so I began “dressing down” and sometimes not even wearing makeup – basically dulling my own sparkle! But I soon realised I had to dress up and show up for MYSELF and others! That allows me to be ME and inspire people I meet by being authentic3. We both worked on a “secret assignment” in February where you told me about your journey to give your mind and body a fresh start. What led to that?I think when you live through something like a pandemic and realise that the ultimate gift is time and health, you want more of it.  I want to be there for my kids and witness all their milestones. With a family history of heart disease and stroke on both sides, it’s an eye opener.4. Where did you even begin?It was all part of putting myself first and that meant going back to basics after lockdown started to show “around the edges”. My journey began in January 2021. It was a little bit of hard work and a lot of common sense. To “reset” I had a meal and exercise plan drawn up by an excellent trainer. It was actually a lot of food and easy DIY workouts. I got healthy and saw amazing physical change. I have maintained that – sharing a lot of my journey along the way.5. The public and social media can be your best friend and worst enemy. There must have been many opinions about your self-care journey/transformation?I was so nervous to put myself out there but when I did, I realised how similar we are as women. We have the same struggles and sometimes we just need encouragement. If there were 100 responses, 98 were cheering me on. Many of them signed up with my coach or asked for tips and advice. There were a few negative comments, but we don’t waste energy on those.6. How have you tried to change perceptions of beauty?This is a constant struggle which I feel has become more overwhelming with social media, body and face editing apps. We must accept that our scars tell our stories.  I use my platform to share encouraging information and also share myself “raw” eg. without make-up.  This is all deeply connected to mental health and I like to remind people that beauty fades, but how you feel mentally and physically is what\"s most important.7. What next for Candice Abrahams?Whoever is reading this, if you need help spreading your wings, let me be your coach! Let me help you! Coaching has always been something I wanted to do. It seems 2022 has interesting  plans for me because the last few weeks of self-discovery, working on the “ secret project” allowed me to jump into some deep water and I swam gracefully, so who knows?"

        "heading": "THE STAGNATION OF FOCUS ON GENDER BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) IN SOUTH AFRICA",
        "description": "",
        "content": "The long-awaited National Council on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide Bill was finally published. While the gazetting of this Bill is a major step forward in driving a multi-sectoral, coherent strategic policy and programming framework to ensure a coordinated national response to the crisis of Gender-Based Violence and Femicide, civil society initiatives continue to bridge the gap. 1st for Women looks at where we are at with three government-level interventions towards ending GBV: the National Council on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (NCGBVF), the DNA backlog, and Life-Skills curriculum delivery in public schools. NATIONAL COUNCIL ON GBV  The establishment of the National Council on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (NCGBVF) was one of the key promises made by President Cyril Ramaphosa in 2019. The NCGBVF is tasked with implementing the National Strategic Plan on GBVF. Without the NCGBVF there can be no effective action against GBV by the government. In 2019 an Interim Steering Committee (ISC) was created to establish the NCGBVF, but the ISC was unable to complete its mandate before being dissolved. The Commission on Gender Equality has noted that beyond failing to fulfil its mandate, the ISC lacked transparency and accountability in its operation. The task of establishing the NCGBVF then fell to an Inter-ministerial committee (IMC). The IMC’s work to establish the NCGBVF was marred by the exclusion of civil society organisations, a seemingly deliberate circumvention of legislative accountability and further delays. Instead of following the correct process to draft legislation for the establishment of the NCGBVF, the IMC created an executive body with no accountability to take on the task of establishing the NCGBVF. This would have been the third body to take on the mandate, however, the Commission on Gender Equality found that the structure of the executive body appeared to take on the role of the NCGBVF. This move appeared to be a disingenuous attempt at skirting responsibility while millions of South Africans were left defenceless in the face of the GBV epidemic. After public outcry, which prompted parliamentary intervention, the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities (DWYPD) course corrected by drafting legislation for the proper establishment of the NCGBVF. In a meeting of the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities on 15 March this year, Member of Parliament, Honourable Nazley Sharif, stated the Portfolio Committee is well aware of the many delays that have taken place. While presenting a petition regarding the establishment of the NCGBVF she stated that “it is no surprise Honourable Members that civil society agrees with us as the PC that this needs to be prioritised and implemented as soon as possible.” She then urged the DWYPD to fast-track the establishment of the NCGBVF. PROGRESS Minster in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane announced the publication of the National Council on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide Bill, 2022 (“the Bill”) on 30 September 2022. The purpose of the publication was to inform the public that the Minister intends to introduce the Bill in parliament in terms of section 73 of the Constitution. THE DNA BACKLOG Processing criminal cases, including sexual abuse cases, depends heavily on Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) analysis. Disconcertingly, there are 58 000 cases awaiting analysis in South Africa’s DNA backlog. This can be discouraging for survivors of crime, who might lack the confidence to report an incident due to apparent capacity deficits at police stations.  To this end, the Criminal Law Bill - Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Bill (B25 - 2021) (CO Bill) was introduced. This will help with more efficient processing of DNA. Until now, there has been a risk of further offences without detection. The amended Criminal Law Bill implies, amongst other things, that previously unrelated crimes can be tracked and linked if there is a repeat offender. “The release of prisoners back into society prior to having a search of their DNA profile on the national DNA database potentially misses the opportunity to identify a serial rapist as well as provides an opportunity to reoffend without detection,” says Dr Vanessa Lynch of DNA for Africa. She adds, “If the DNA backlog is a concern, the police can easily prioritise at the very least those convicted offenders who are due for parole prior to being released.”     An important distinction is made by Dr Lynch: “Note the difference between ‘cases’ and ’samples’. The DNA backlog refers to cases, and there are probably between 3-10 samples per case. This means the number of DNA samples in backlog is well over a million.”  PROGRESS Despite the delays, there are some signs of progress. As of 25 May 2022, a budget of an additional R100 million was allocated to support all programmes related to GBVF Action Plans and FCS Unit Resourcing. Another R50 million was set aside by Police Minister Bheki Cele to support all buccal samples and collection kits operations. GBV EDUCATION  Violence at school-level manifests itself especially in bullying, which can be physical, verbal or virtual (ie. cyberbullying).  As many as 57% of high schoolers have reported experiencing bullying at some point in their secondary school career, according to 1000 Women Trust.  The Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention  found in 2013 that “most of the incidents of violence in schools are perpetrated by learners themselves”. This shows the significance of addressing learner behaviour through education. In 2016, the Department of Basic Education (DBE) published a National School Safety Framework. DBE Minister Angie Motshekga described this as “minimum standard” for holding schools, districts, and provinces accountable to foster safe schools. The National School Safety Framework, together with the National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence are remarkable documents on educating children towards ending violence. However, the challenge is not policy - it is practice. There is little ‘on the ground’ evidence of government implementation of the aforementioned policies. Recent case-study research carried out on behalf of 1st for Women has shown the work of non-profit organisations (NGOs), which, in large part drive transformative education towards non-violence among children. Organisations such as Masimanyane Women’s Rights International, Action Breaks Silence, Regional Psychosocial Support Initiatives (REPSSI), The Justice Desk and others are examples of NGOs that bridge the gap. Action Breaks Silence, for example, is a partner of the 1st for Women Foundation and has a flagship project in primary schools in Diepsloot. In 2021, the organisation reached 1 417 primary school learners (grade five to seven) in five primary schools. A further 1800 young women in grades eight to 11 were reached by the same organisation, through community-level workshops on topics like recognising indications of potentially dangerous behaviours by perpetrators. Participants have noted that following the workshop they feel less fearful, more empowered, and more capable of defending themselves with tools they could immediately put into action.  According to the head of Reshomile Primary School’s Life Skills and Life Orientation department: “Usually, we\"d see a number of cases of bullying or cases of learners waiting for others outside so that [they] can fight.  However, since the programme started, our incident report book is empty. I believe this programme is a success.” “It helps if everyone is speaking about the same thing,” Programme Manager Niki Hall-Jones puts it simply. Staff and volunteers of GBV organisations are clear about the need to facilitate conversations between generations and genders.  Another partner of 1st for Women is the Regional Psychosocial Support Initiative (REPSSI). Celeste Mattross, Country Director of REPSSI South Africa, explains the ground-level status of violence education in schools: “Typically this is due to happen in Life Orientation (LO) classrooms, but teachers have come forward to ask for help in delivering the LO curriculum.” PROGRESS The future of reducing school-level violence seems to be in relevant and relatable education, delivered by partner organisations. While we wait for government to deliver, stakeholders outside the classroom hold the key to safe schools. CONCLUSION The Criminal Law Bill - Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Bill (B25 - 2021) (CO Bill), National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and the National Council on Gender Based Violence and Femicide Bill are key pieces of legislation which can create progress in ending violence against women and children.   While we wait for approval and implementation at government-level, we will continue to be reminded that there is a war being raged on women’s bodies and their safety is under constant threat. According to statistics released by the SAPS, over a three-month period (January to March 2022), murder, attempted murder and the assault of women all recorded double-digit increases and over 10,800 rape cases were reported."

        "description": "",
        "content": "In a world often defined by challenges and uncertainties, the concept of fearlessness takes on a profound significance. Being a fearless woman goes beyond simply disregarding fear; it involves acknowledging it, understanding its source, and ultimately transcending its limitations. This journey toward fearlessness is a choice and is testament to the strength and resilience that all women possess. To help more women realise their indomitable strength, and demonstrate what it means to be fearless, 1st for Women partnered with three icons. Here are their stories: The Boys Club Can’t Take My FearlessFearlessness begins with challenging stereotypes and expectations that have historically confined women to predefined roles. At the age of six, Janine van Wyk fell in love with football, a male-dominated sport. By 2005, she made her debut for South Africa in the African Women’s Championship and in 2013, she was appointed Captain of Banyana Banyana. She also became the first Captain in history to lead South Africa at a Women’s World Cup. She is now the highest-capped soccer player in South Africa (male or female) with 183 appearances and the highest-capped female in the Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF). “I believe in living a life that’s free of the fear of judgment, the fear of criticism, and the fear of not being enough. And when fear does creep in, I confront it and fight back against it. I believe that women have inner strength and can accomplish anything we put our minds to. Be yourself, be a leader, be courageous and strong, take risks, and trust that you can achieve anything you want,” says Van Wyk. This is the inspiration Van Wyk used when she co-founded the football club JVW FC in 2013. The core principle of the club was to create opportunities for girls of all ages to play football in a comfortable environment, where each player is encouraged and motivated to participate and give their best according to their ability. A Stroke Can’t Take My Fearless Being fearless doesn’t mean being devoid of vulnerability. Fearless women recognise the strength of being authentic and vulnerable. They share their stories, acknowledge their struggles, and connect on a deeper level with others who may be facing similar challenges. In March 2022, Lira (foremost female artist and icon Lerato Molapo) was in Frankfurt, Germany. While walking around the city, the songstress suffered a stroke. While the stroke took Lira’s ability to speak, it did not take her fearlessness. Lira explains that being fearless is a choice: “It’s about letting go of what you thought your life was supposed to be and just embracing where you are now - and how special it is. I am alive and kicking and that is what matters. To truly live, celebrate each day of your life. Let each day be a festival of joy.” Challenges Can’t Take My FearlessFearless women are smashing glass ceilings and showing the world that there are no limits to what they can achieve. In March 2023, 1st for Women announced that Anele Mdoda (radio presenter and popular social personality) would be its ambassador of Fearless – a move that made complete sense as Mdoda makes her voice heard with authenticity, passion, and perseverance. “It’s not that I have nothing to fear but rather, knowing that I have the power to change my narrative from one of fear to one of fearlessness and living a life in which my fears don’t hold me back. It’s about action, despite the fear, and walking with freedom, strength, and hope in the face of things unknown,” says Anele. Mdoda goes on to say that by removing the barriers to fearlessness – the fear of failure, the need to be perfect, and the risk of judgment – any woman can live with optimism and confidence, and power through with true intention and purpose. Mdoda believes that when you define yourself to and for yourself, the opinions of others will matter less. “Power is the change you want to see. Don’t get side-tracked – know what you want and steer everything towards that, even when current conditions appear contrary to your vision. Despite the chaos that surrounds us, women have an indomitable strength to take action.”  Fearless women are rewriting history, dismantling stereotypes, and inspiring future generations to reach for their dreams without hesitation. Through their unwavering determination, resilience, and boundless courage, they are shaping a world where gender is not a barrier to success. As we celebrate our achievements, let’s be reminded that fearlessness knows no bounds when women stand united in their pursuit of a brighter future."

The other girls preferred hockey and netball but Janine had her sights set on the typically male-dominated sport. As a teenager, Janine joined a football team in KwaThema. There she was spotted by a former technical director of the South African Football Association, who invited Janine to enrol in a high-performance programme in Pretoria. “The boarding-school environment was tough. I was homesick and couldn’t cope. I only stayed there for six months because I needed my family with me,” says Janine. She kept playing football though, hoping that one day she’d earn her a place in the national side. “Nothing worth having comes easy and I worked hard to make my dream a reality,” says Janine. In 2005, Janine made her debut for South Africa in the African Women’s Championship and in 2013, she was appointed Captain of Banyana Banyana and became the first Captain in history to lead South Africa at a Women’s World Cup. She is now the highest capped soccer player in South Africa (male or female) with 183 appearances, and highest capped female in the Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF). Despite not making the squad for the 2023 FIFA Women\"s World Cup due to an injury, Janine says she’s not read to hang up her boots just yet. “I have an important record to break - to be the most capped player on the African continent, male or female.” There’s no doubt that she will achieve her goal because Janine is fearless. “I believe in living a life that’s free of the fear of judgement, the fear of criticism and the fear of not being enough.

The core principle of the dream was to create opportunities for girls of all ages to play football in a comfortable environment, where each player is encouraged and motivated to participate and give their best according to their ability. “When I was younger, there were many times when I felt isolated and not part of the team because I am a woman. There have been so many barriers but I have continuously let my passion and my love of the game shine through.”"

It had been three-years since she travelled and she was looking forward to her upcoming performance with Swedish XXX . While walking around the city, taking in the sights and sounds, the songstress suffered a stroke. Lira said that the sensation lasted about 15 minutes. “I had no idea what was happening, so I kept walking and nobody could see that I had a stroke because I was walking normally. I walked into a restaurant but I couldn’t talk - I moved my mouth, but words couldn’t come out. When I realised this, I just broke down. The restaurant staff offered me a seat. I couldn’t communicate. I thought about asking them for directions to my hotel, but I couldn’t communicate that. Once I stopped crying and got myself together, I left. It took me 2 hours to find my hotel.”It was about 7pm when Lira arrived at her hotel. She couldn’t communicate with the receptionist so she took a shower, and tried to communicate via WhatsApp - but she couldn’t type. “The words made absolutely no sense to me. I couldn’t figure out what the letters meant and how to put them together.” In the morning, Lira’s agent sent two people to her room. An ambulance was called and when Lira got to the hospital, she was told that it was a stroke. “I was shocked. I cried the whole day but in the morning, I accepted my situation.” A stroke may have taken Lira’s speech, but not her fearless.

Let each day be a festival of joy.” “My mom taught me that you don’t back down from anything life throws at you. She showed me support when I went after my dreams and when I had a stroke. She did it with such grace, composure and strength. That’s where my fearless comes from. I have been learning how to speak again, learning how to say each letter and forming a sentence. I did so joyfully - I had no anxiety, no stress - just peace and calm. I have made such huge progress. When learning how to speak again - I’ve enjoyed listening and the silence. I’ve learnt to be happier. I’ve learnt to enjoy the simple things. Life is a gift and I hope to celebrate the gift of life for many years.”"

        "content": "JUDGEMENT can’t take my fearlessIn March 2023, 1st for Women announced that it had appointed Anele Mdoda to be its ambassador of fearless. The partnership makes absolute sense – being fearless is a choice and Anele makes this choice every day. She invests in confidence over fear, and is unapologetic about making her voice heard. She does all this with authenticity, powered by passion and perseverance. “It’s not that I have nothing to fear but rather, knowing that I have the power to change my narrative from one of fear, to one of fearlessness and living a life in which my fears don’t hold me back. It’s about action, despite the fear, and walking with freedom, strength and hope in the face of things unknown,” says Anele. Anele says that harnessing the power of being fearless is an exercise in growth, resilience, and persistence and she has put coping mechanisms in place to ensure that when fear creeps in, she bounces back. “The three things I do fearlessly are motherhood, my career and love. By removing the barriers to fearlessness - the fear of failure, the need to be perfect, not feeling good enough, the risk of judgement, overthinking things or feeling like I wouldn\"t be strong enough to cope if things didn’t go my way – I can bounce-back with optimism and confidence, and power through with true intention and purpose, motivated by something that’s more important than unrealistic expectations,” says Anele. Anele wears her queen of radio crown with pride but says that there isn’t a single achievement that she takes for granted. “My journey has not always been easy. In the rise and fall of opportunities and crises, there have been steep learning curves, deep detours of distraction and illuminating shards of wisdom. There have been occasions when others tripped me up, and there have been many times when I myself have taken missteps and lost my way but I continue to rise thanks to an inherent fearlessness.” Anele believes that when you define yourself to and for yourself, the opinions of others will matter less. “Power is the change you want to see. Don’t get side-tracked – know that what you want and steer everything towards that, even when current conditions appear contrary to your vision. Despite the chaos that surrounds us, women have an indomitable strength to take action.”"

        "content": "‘Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much’. That is a well-known quote from Helen Keller which she voiced on numerous occasions during many of her stage performances in the mid-1940s, yet this adage still rings true in modern times.In today’s world, everyone seems to be too busy and too under pressure to help the next person. As much as we need to focus on building our ideal lives and creating the best futures for ourselves, we need to keep in mind that when women work together towards a common goal, so much greatness can be achieved.Here are just two examples of incredible women who paired up to reach their goals and aspirations.Building a cake empire - it’s a sibling thing Many of us have age-old family recipes which have been passed down from generation to generation, like that incredible apple tart your grandmother taught your mother to make, or that mouth-watering chocolate ganache cake your aunt always makes for the festive season. Few of us take these recipes and turn them into successful ventures, but that’s exactly what Nokuthula Ramputa and her sister Thokozile Mahlangu did.Thokozile studied hotel management and Nokuthula studied culinary art. The duo then took their qualifications and merged them with their joint love for baking and cooking, and set off on a journey of persistence, determination and most importantly, team work by opening a cake shop with their mother’s support. Their future goals are to set up shop in all 9 provinces in SA and open a baking school.The most prominent lesson we can learn from this sister couple is working together towards a common goal often makes the journey easier and the rewards much, much sweeter.The mompreneurship journey - from sisters to partnersSisters Bayanda and Buhle were both pregnant with baby girls in late 2014 when they went out shopping for baby clothes and realized that there were not enough gender-neutral clothes. That’s what inspired them to start an online children’s clothing store where they create gender-neutral clothing for kids.Having now committed to their business fulltime and are following their joint dream, the ladies are finding that it is easier to overcome challenges and reach for their goals when they work together and offer support to each other, a lesson that can be applied to many women’s lives.The duo has big plans for their business – they plan on expanding the brand by bringing in other aspects, such as children’s decor.These real life examples of sisters working together towards common goals and supporting one another along the way is enough proof that when women work together to achieve their dreams, anything is possible.1st for Women understands that you are well on your way to achieving great things, and because we know that you might need some help along the way, we are giving you the chance to win a brand new Renault Clio that will make the journey all the more enjoyable.

        "content": "Moms are the people we go to for advice, a pillar of support and a source of infinite love. But they are also human, susceptible to heartbreak, pain and disappointment. And very often these are things they feel on behalf of their children. Nothing is more heart-breaking then seeing your child remaining in a situation that is unhealthy or harmful to them. Many moms witness this with daughters stuck in a cycle of abuse with a violent partner, leaving them feeling completely helpless. You aren’t. The fact that you know she is in an abusive situation, means you are already in a position to help her. If you suspect she is being abused and want to confirm this suspicion, here are some signs to look out for.Some signs your daughter is in an abusive relationshipLashing out or becoming withdrawn – if you ask if everything is okay, she often reacts defensively and closes up.Acts with extreme vigilance – she watches everything she says and does around her partner.Excuses their behaviour – she minimises the abuse, often blaming herself– ‘he’s just very stressed’, ‘I shouldn’t have made him angry’, etc. Remind her that any type of abuse, in any shape or form, is unacceptable.Is non-challenging – never asserts herself or contradicts anything her partner says.Develops physical symptoms – this includes depression, increased fatigue and high levels of anxiety.Develops psychological symptoms – has extremely low self-esteem and constantly feels inadequate and unworthy.  Practical advice for taking actionOnce she has opened up and realised the severity of her situation, you can start planning for her escape. From a practical perspective, leaving an abusive partner can be extremely difficult. There are however helpful steps, you can advise her to follow, which could make her departure easier:Step 1: Preparing to leaveIf she is in imminent danger, there is no time to plan. In that situation she should call the police or 10111 immediately. If she cannot get to the phone, she should scream as loud as possible, break things or set off the alarm, anything to get the attention of neighbours and passers-by. If she has time to prepare to leave, here’s what she can do: Seek organisations that can help – she can visit www.for-women.co.za, an online platform that brings organisations fighting women abuse together in one place. Here she can get the help she needs, from the closest place possible, which can offer the advice, security and/or support she needs.Source a safe house – you both may feel that she won’t be safe staying with you or another family member or friend. In this case, a shelter is the ideal place for her (and her children) to receive the security and support needed. Since addresses of safe houses are not openly publicised, for the safety of its residents, she’ll need to call a relevant hotline or visit www.for-women.co.za to find a safe house in the area. Make sure she uses your cell phone or computer to look for information and make calls in case her partner is monitoring her phone and internet history. Memorise emergency numbers – these are extremely important especially if she’s in a situation where she is facing imminent threat. These numbers include the Gender-Based Violence Hotline (0800 428 428) or the Tears SMS line (*134*7355#).Organise emergency funds – financial abuse is a prominent form of abuse and the reason many women feel trapped in an abusive situation. If you’re not in a financial position to support her until she is back on her feet, she’ll need to be creative in saving for an emergency fund. Some ideas are holding onto any change she can, hiding money given to her as a gift or getting a credit card in her name. She’ll need to ensure that statements are sent to her work address or your email address, so her partner won’t see them, and she should avoid accessing online banking from her own phone or home computer.Save evidence of abuse – this includes pictures of injuries, clothing with blood on it and any hospital documents that point to abuse.  Whenever she is injured she must visit a doctor or hospital as these records could be crucial in receiving things like protection orders and custody of children.Have a getaway bag packed and hidden – pack a bag with all her personal necessities, and copies of important documents, for her and her kids, and make sure to hide the bag to ensure her partner won’t find it.Prepare the kids too – if your daughter has children, here are some safety planning tips for kids that may help give her some added peace of mind.Step 2: How to actually leave Choose an escape window and destination – she’ll need to choose a time when she knows her abuser will be away from home, based on their usual schedule. If she doesn’t have her own transport, she’ll need to call you to pick her up or arrange someone to do so. If you’ve found a safe place for her to go, she’ll need the address memorised to get their quickly and easily. If she is coming to your home or to  that of another family member or friend, you should all prepare to expect her at any time or give her a key to your premises so she get in quickly. Even if she feels safe at someone’s home, she should still contact a support organisation, like those listed on For-Women to get legal help and counselling.Leave her cell phone behind – in case her abuser has set up tracking on her phone, she should leave this device behind. If you can source her a cheap or second-hand phone that she could use as an alternative that would be ideal as she can use this to save emergency contacts, make calls and send messages.Step 3: What to do after she’s leftSeek legal advice – organisations like Lawyers Against Abuse provide free legal services and psychosocial support to victims of gender-based violence. She can connect with them at www.for-women.co.za.Apply for a protection order – help her do this by printing out this Application for Protection Order form which she can take to the nearest police station.Whilst 1st for Women is working towards preventing women abuse from happening, these are helpful steps that you and your daughter can follow in the meantime. You can also reach out to a growing network of organisations fighting women abuse at www.for-women.co.za and get help or give help today.The information in this article is provided for information purposes only and does not constitute professional advice."

        "content": "South Africa’s fight against women abuse needs to be tackled holistically through a programme of prevention, preparation and provision. It is a complex and multi-faceted problem comprising different types of abuse and underlying causes. However, through strength in numbers, by coming together and making our voices heard, all South Africans can work together and give abuse the boot for good.As part of 1st for Women’s Seeking Solutions survey and research report, these and other aspects of women abuse are being unpacked so that we can all take action and find real solutions to end the cycle of abuse.We asked 1 214 local respondents, comprising both men and women, what they believe is the most prevalent form of women abuse. Both demographics rated physical abuse as the highest at 97%.Interestingly, the Crime Against Women in South Africa report released by Stats SA, revealed to what extent South African women have normalised violence against them, in certain situations. Based on the findings, one in every 40 South African women believe that – under certain circumstances – it is completely justifiable for a man to hit a woman.According to the report, a man is justified in hitting his wife or partner if she neglects the children or if a woman argues with her husband. These two transgressions are considered the most serious issues.While both men and women rated physical violence as the principal form of women abuse, there seems to be some level of acceptance when it happens, and this is why it can be difficult for women to recognise that being physically abused is never ok.Based on our findings, the single biggest cause of women abuse was listed as the structure of society including patriarchy and cultural norms. This certainly provides some insight into parts of society’s seeming levels of acceptance.If friends, family, neighbours, colleagues, religious leaders, politicians and celebrities, whether men or women, believe that women abuse of any kind is in some way justified, the ability to report it and get help for the survivor becomes near impossible.The Seeking Solutions findings also showed that respondents listed emotional abuse as the second most prominent form of women abuse at 96% followed by sexual harassment at 93%. The exacerbation of this abuse is certainly coupled with the other causes of women abuse, listed as alcohol abuse at 23% and prejudice and sexism at 16%.To support women in taking the first step in the fight against women abuse, more needs to be done to call out abusive behaviour and help everyone recognise it is never ok.The #MeToo movement illustrated what happens when women come forward and expose incidents of abuse to the public. It helps society see and understand that it is not acceptable to abuse a woman in any way. Our survey highlighted that both education, as it relates to educating the police on how to handle women abuse cases with sensitivity and respect, intervention programmes for young boys and men on what constitutes women abuse and toxic masculinity as well as broader public service announcements educating society at large on the types of women abuse and its underlying causes, and empowerment of women were critical solutions to stopping women abuse.The For-Women.co.za platform is a resource for women to become both educated and empowered. They can easily connect with an NGO to get advice and assistance if they have been affected by such abuse. By connecting with an NGO, they can get access to counselling, protection orders, support and crisis centres they need.As a survivor of women abuse, take the first step by connecting with an NGO to get help. As an individual or South African corporate, take the first step and give help by donating time, funding our resources to an NGO."

They  do phenomenal work to empower victims of gender-based violence (GBV) to realise their legal rights through the provision of holistic legal and psychosocial support services.Through this strategic combination of support, LvA has empowered 1,213 GBV victims to recognise their available legal rights and remedies as they pursued either a protection order or criminal case against their perpetrator. With this comprehensive support, LvA clients are more likely to see their case through to completion despite various obstacles, with only three clients choosing not to proceed with their criminal case this year.In a parallel process, LvA clients who received therapy or counselling services experienced significant shifts, rediscovering a sense of hope, confidence, trust, perseverance and self-esteem during their sessions. Some beneficiaries were empowered to take positive steps to increase their own safety and the safety of their children, for example, by leaving abusive relationships or pursuing available legal remedies.LvA also works to strengthen the local justice system’s response to GBV through accountability and capacitation initiatives. Through LvA’s ongoing monitoring of case progression and state-actor behaviour, direct engagement regarding misconduct, and facilitation of capacity-strengthening workshops, LvA helped ensure that perpetrators of violence were held accountable for their actions.During the last year, three perpetrators in LvA-supported criminal cases were convicted of sexual offences against minors. While one perpetrator was awarded a 25-year sentence, the remaining two perpetrators received extremely lenient sentences compared to the severity of the offence. LvA will be following up with the relevant prosecutors regarding an appeal of these sentences.Further, Interim Protection Orders were granted in 97% of matters where it was confirmed that clients had submitted an application, and Final Protection Orders were granted in 76% of matters where clients attended the final hearing.As you can see, protecting the legal rights of victims of GBV is extremely challenging. But LvA refuses to back down, continuing to fight for justice and keep more women safe. That’s why we’re proud to support them.When you join 1st for Women, you support them too. That’s because a portion of your premium is donated to the 1st for Foundation, which supports LvA and other organisations dedicated to fighting woman abuse.Click here to find out more about LvA and here to learn more about the 1st for Women Foundation.

        "description": "",
        "content": "On 8 March 2021, the world celebrated the achievements of women, raising awareness against bias, challenging stereotypes and taking action for equality for International Women’s Day (IWD). This year’s theme, #ChoosetoChallenge, is drawn from a notion that from challenge comes change, so choose to challenge and call out gender bias and inequality.  According to Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women Insurance: “Sheryl Sandberg got people talking about gender equality at work with her best-seller, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead (Knopf, 2013). But eight years later, there is still much progress to be made. Bias is holding women back in the workplace, making it harder for women to get hired and promoted and negatively impacting their day-to-day work experiences. Sandberg notes that 73% of women experience bias at work - yet less than a third of employees are able to recognise bias when they see it.” This is why #ChoosetoChallenge is a hashtag that every South African women should take note of.  “Unfortunately, gender bias is alive and kicking in South Africa and is starkly evidenced by our glaring gender pay gap. PwC’s Executive directors: practices and remuneration trends report 2020 tells us that the gender pay gap for large-cap JSE companies stands at a disappointing 45%, dropping to 39% for mid-cap companies and 25% for small- cap companies. If you look through an industry lens, the difference in the gender pay gap ranges from 7% in the financial services industry to as much as 34% in the real estate industry,” says van Wyngaard. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2020, it will take another 100 years to achieve gender equality based on the current rate of progress. However, if women choose to challenge gender bias, a fairer and more inclusive workplace can be created for all. LeanIn.Org have developed a free digital programme to empower all employees to identify and challenge bias head on.  Some of the advice to help combat the biases women face at work includes: Guard against microaggressions: this refers to daily discrimination and is usually directed towards people in junior positions. Encourage staff to be more conscious of their words and tone when speaking to colleagues.Stop Interrupting! How many times do men interrupt women compared to interrupting their male colleagues?  The answer is almost three times more often. Stop interrupting!Meeting dynamics: In a meeting room situation, men tend to sit front and centre, while women take positions to the side or the back. Make sure that there is sufficient room and encourage staff to move around so that the gender distribution in the room is more equal and women are placed in positions where they feel confident to speak up.Confident women are labelled “aggressive”: Old, ingrained stereotypes mean that women are traditionally expected to be agreeable and a forceful stance on a sticking discussion point sometimes results in women being viewed as aggressive or pushy in the workplace. Employers and co-workers should stop to ask themselves what their reaction would be if the same comments or viewpoint was expressed by a male counterpart before reacting with a knee-jerk response.Get women on boards: The JSE remains heavily weighted towards male non-executive directors at 71%. This indicates little progress from the previous year, when there were 70 percent male and 30 percent female directors. There is no shortage of women qualified to represent companies in the boardroom. Mentorship programmes at C-suite level should be encouraged wherever possible.Educate, educate, educate: Often staff and even management are not entirely aware of their own, ingrained biases. Run workplace training to emphasise the benefits of gender equality, including connection with and access to customers, diversity of ideas, and supplier diversity. “They say it is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves. The fight against gender inequality is a battle that each and every one of us can contribute to. While Covid-19 has been devastating, it has had a global spin-off effect of forcing companies to re-evaluate their thinking around working hour flexibility and making management more amenable to accepting work-from-home positions. Incremental changes today can lead to massive changes in years to come,” van Wyngaard concludes."

        "content": "In 1955, a car manufacturer launched a car specifically designed for women.  It featured floral upholstery and a matching accessories including a rain cape, handbag, lipstick and compact.  Needless to say, it wasn’t a hit amongst the ladies who saw straight through its offensive and stereotypical ruse. Decades later, another car manufacturer launched a car for women in, you guessed it, pink.  It featured a windscreen designed to block harmful UV rays, helping to keep the driver wrinkle-free and a \"plasmacluster\" air conditioning system that apparently improves skin quality.  Again, women were not impressed.  “Women’s World Car of the Year results have recently been released and thankfully, there wasn’t a pink car in sight.  In fact, the winner, voted by a majority of 50 women motoring journalists from 38 countries on five continents, was a very unisex Land Rover Defender, chosen for its technology and comfort,” says Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women Insurance.   “Considering that 80% of car-buying decisions are influenced by women, manufacturers should take note - there is a very fine line between appealing to women and patronising them,” notes van Wyngaard. Now that we know that pink cars with pastel seat covers and headrests designed to accommodate ponytails won’t hit the mark, what do women want in cars? “Women want the same things everyone wants in a car – durability and reliability.  Studies show that that when buying a car, safety is of primary importance to a woman followed by vehicle performance and economy – both in the price, fuel efficiency and the running costs.  Women also feel strongly about how their cars affect the environment,” said van Wyngaard. A recent study conducted by BuyaCar.co.uk found that women approach car buying with a more practical head than men, who tend to care more about the image of the cars they choose. It also found while men have made black their first colour of choice recently, women continue to choose white first.  1st for Women advises using the following tips when making the very important decision to buy a car: Research carefully: Read reviews of cars available online and in magazines and newspapers, in order to be as informed as possible when comparing the various features of the cars.Set your price target: Once you have found theaverage selling price of the vehicle you are thinking of buying, do not pay above that average unless you want special options included.Calculate your costs:  Before you visit a car dealership or shopping online, you need to determine how much you can pay, after factoring in how long you are willing to make car payments. Look at your budget carefully and be realistic about how much you can afford to spend on car instalments and running costs.Needs Analysis:  Make sure that the car you are considering buying is a logical fit with your needs.Resale Value: Look at the resale value of the make of car you’re eyeing. With fuel prices volatile and on the rise, cars with large engines, poor fuel economy and high running costs generally don’t resale well.Shop Around:  Never jump at the first deal.  An informed decision can make the difference between a great buy and an expensive mistake. van Wyngaard concludes: “Choosing which car to buy is an emotional decision. We all want to drive a car that makes us feel happy, proud, and says something about who we are. But, for all intents and purposes, you should buy a vehicle that suits your needs, and one that you can not only afford to buy but also keep on the road.”"

        "description": "",
        "content": "According to a survey conducted by the American Automobile Association (AAA), men drive more aggressively than women.  The survey found that men outpace women in nearly every aggressive driving category - excessive speeding (52%), tailgating (37.8%), aggressive hooting (35.4%), running red lights (32.2%) and dangerous lane switching (31.5%) – but women are not completely blameless. 1st for Women recently conducted its own survey to gauge if and how South African women keep their cool on the road, and the results were strikingly similar to the AAA survey.   “Our research revealed that women frown upon reckless activities such as tailgating (8.3%), running red lights (11.1%) and dangerous lane switching (2.8%) but do admit to speeding (47.2%) and aggressive hooting (25%),” says Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women Insurance. To keep their cool on the road, women tend to leave earlier so they have more time to get to their destination (58.3%) and ignore aggressive drivers (50%).  The majority of survey respondents found that listening to Gospel or R&amp;B music helps soothes flaring tempers.“Speed is a factor in approximately one-third of fatal crashes on South African roads.  Speeding not only increases your chances of having an accident but it also drastically increases the severity of a crash and injuries when it happens.  We urge South African motorists – both men and women – to stick to the speed limit at all times,” says van Wyngaard. Here are some of 1st for Women Insurance’s essential tips for avoiding road rage:Get enough sleep. The National Sleep Foundation found that tiredness is a contributing factor to road rage and makes us more prone to anger and annoyance. In addition, the foundation also states that going just 18 hours without sleep is comparable to having a blood alcohol content of 0.05%Don’t rush. Do you often whiz through your morning routine chaotically hoping to get to work just in time? If so, then give yourself some extra time to actively plan, to get dressed, prepare those school lunches, fill up the fuel tank in time and make your appointment. More time means calmer driving.It’s not a tank. Remember that your vehicle is a mode of transportation, not a weapon. Driving a car makes people feel more protected, allowing them to act in ways they normally wouldn’t. So when another driver swerves into your lane on their cellphone, respond as though you\"re not in a car.Listen to mood music. It makes sense that classical music, relaxing tunes or even comedy will reduce your stress. You can even try an audiobook to tune out the rat race outside your car.“Just breathe” really works. Relax that grip on the steering wheel and unclench your teeth. Some deep breathing exercises and even stretching behind the wheel can cool off a hot temper.It’s not about you. The fact that someone else is driving badly is not a personal attack.  Hostility is toxic for your health so no matter how much someone has angered you, try and let it go.Analyse your own behaviour. Do you speed? How often do you text and drive? Do you often swear while driving? If so, you might be the aggressive driver.Practice kindness. Follow the “do unto others” rule."

        "content": "Author Shubnum Khan’s story is one of breaking free of the “expectations” of a single Muslim woman in South Africa. Her second book, “How I Accidentally became a Global Stock Photo” is receiving a lot of attention. It takes us through her adventures from teaching children in a remote Himalayan village to becoming a bride on a rooftop in Shanghai – and having her face splashed on billboards across the world for all kinds of adverts – accidentally! It’s the story of a gutsy single woman whose journeys were filled with unexpected twists and turns. She spoke to media personality Uveka Rangappa about being fearless!1. Of all your adventures, which would you say was your “Fearless” first?I think the first time I tried to do something that was completely out of my realm of comfort         was when I went to teach in a remote village in the Himalayas. I was so scared to do it but I knew if I didn’t take that first step, I would be stuck and I didn’t want to be living a stuck life. Adapting to village life was hard and quite scary. I’m terrified of everything and there were tremors at night, leopard and bear sightings around us, rumours of jinns (supernatural creatures) and even weird creatures that could get into your ears while you slept. I loved the experience but I was scared a lot of the time.2. Where did you find the “chutzpah” to not fall into a traditional role but go out into the big sometimes bad world ? I didn’t feel like anything in my life would change for most of my twenties. It’s only when I forced myself to take that first step on that journey to myself that things began to change. So I think you really have to believe in yourself and hope for things to happen in your future. I was also lucky to have a supportive family that encouraged me to read which really affected how I saw the world from a young age. It certainly helped that my Dad was a lot more open-minded and supportive of my having new experiences. He was instrumental in me learning how to love myself because he loved all of his four daughters completely. And that really helped when I was trying to be brave.3, In many families there’s always the question of “What will people say?” when someone, especially a woman, does things her way. Did that ever bother you?I used to be a people pleaser and I was always scared of what people would say. It bothered me a lot when people commented on me being unmarried, not having children or my writing. I’ve realised people will always have something to say regardless. You just have to go on! I tend to be very selective of who I let in now. I know the people whose opinions I care about and those I don’t.4. You’ve done so much already with adventures in the Himalayas, Turkey, New Mexico, New York, and Shanghai to name a few. What’s next for Shubnum Khan?It’s hard to say because of COVID but I’d love to see Japan and parts of Europe soon. I’m also working on a new novel which is set in a mysterious house in Durban.  5. A final word to other women on being Fearless.I’m scared every single day but I also know I want to have the best possible journey I can because this life is mine and it’s so short. And there is so much to see and do and no one should be able to hold me back from being the best I can be. Auth non-life Ins &amp; FSP. "

        "content": "After spending years on the “playgrounds” of the rich and glamorous, self-love expert, Nikki Loots, gave it all up and found herself on a journey of self-discovery – a “love affair” with herself where she finally came to understand true joy and happiness. She now teaches women all over the world how to start living their best lives. But that means overcoming certain fears and taking chances. Nikki told media personality Uveka Rangappa about being Fearless through it all. 1. You’ve really LIVED an adventurous life that many would envy. What was your “Fearless first”?My biggest fear was deciding to listen to my heart instead of all the advice from others. I was at a crossroads in my life and wanted to exit the yachting industry after seven years. The money and security were great, but it was soul destroying. I had flown to Indonesia to start a new job and as I set foot in Bali, every atom in my body was screaming, “Do not get on that boat!”An inner voice told me to go find the true meaning of life and discover who I really was. It was petrifying because for 28 years it was always about making everyone else happy. I finally stopped making decisions based on fear, and I listened to my gut, my heart and my intuition. I stayed in Bali, and embarked on a journey of self-realisation, deep self-love and acceptance. Today this is exactly what I teach others. 1. From the age of 21 you worked and lived among rich people in luxury – but you were still not happy – why?I believed wealth solved all problems and brought happiness. While I watched billionaires acquire anything they wanted, I saw emptiness in their eyes, and realised I felt the same. The more I focused on material wealth, the less I felt connected to myself. What did it take to walk away from it?I knew if I wanted my life to change, I had to change. I had spent so many years trying to be the “perfect woman” and wanting others to like me, that I never asked the question, “Do I like myself?” I’d spent years steeped in self-criticism, guilt and shame. When I set the intention to heal my relationship with myself, the path became clear.  4. How do you use your experience to teach women to love themselves?I learnt to take responsibility for my own happiness. I worked through a lot of forgiveness, letting go and acceptance. As a self-love mentor I create a safe space for my clients to do the same. I guide them through different processes to connect to who they really are, what they truly want and to start trusting that they are worthy. Together we work with the subconscious mind, reprogramming life-long beliefs and I provide them with tools to build self-love, confidence and self-worth.  5. Is finding out who they really are, scary for many women? Yes. Many of us have been conditioned to dress, act and speak a certain way as women. If we do not fit the mould, we feel shame and guilt. We are also seldom taught to question who we are. Stripping away all the layers we have built up to fit in can be incredibly frightening. A lot of women are afraid to change in case their partners, family or friends do not like it. The biggest objection I hear from women is that they don’t have the time or money to do the work. 6. What do you say to women about facing their fears and making the change to live their best lives?The person you spend the most time with is yourself. What you think, how you feel, and how you treat yourself matters. Remember it’s YOUR heart, YOUR happiness and YOUR responsibility. Get to know who you are. The more time you spend with yourself, without judgement and expectation, the deeper your bond will grow and you’ll soon start to realise that you’re not looking for the light, you are looking for you. You ARE THE LIGHT!"

        "content": "According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, road traffic collisions are a leading cause of death and injuries for children under the age of 14 in South Africa. The simple truth of this shocking statistic is that if car seats were used safely and correctly, many of these deaths and injuries could have been avoided.  Experts agree. Peggy Mars from Wheel Well, who advocates for Children’s Road Safety in South Africa, has said that car seats and restraints can reduce child deaths by 71% and injuries by 67% if properly used. “The reason of fatality for children in frontal impacts is that they are not correctly restrained,” said Mars. “32% of cases studied were unrestrained and 23% used an inappropriate and/or a misused restraint system.” This Child Passenger Safety Awareness Week, it’s your duty to invest in a safety seat that\"s convenient to use and to make buckling your child into it an ingrained habit – on long distance trips and short ones. Using your car seat properly will make the difference between life and death in an accident. A one-time lapse can result in a lifetime of regret. 1st for Women offers some car seat safety tips: Buy the best car seat you can afford. Beware of bargains, old and secondhand car seats. They may have some unseen damage.If you must use a secondhand seat, make sure it has the original instructions, all its parts (check the manual), hasn’t been in a serious accident or been recalled. Stick with car seats that are less than five years old. There’s usually an expiration date on the seat.Always double-check the car seat\"s label to ensure it\"s the right one for your child\"s age, weight and height.Keep your child rear-facing as long as possible – at least until the age of two or until she/he reaches the seat\"s maximum rear-facing height and weight limits.Your child should ride in a safety seat with a five-point harness until she/he weighs at least 18.5kgs, or until their shoulders no longer fit under the harness straps.Your child should ride in a booster seat from the time she/he weighs 18.5kgs and is at least four years old until they are 4 feet 9 inches tall and at least 8 years old.Make sure your seat is installed correctly.Check to be sure that car seats don\"t tip forward or slide from side to side more than an inch, and that boosters are secured with a lap-and-shoulder belt.Make sure your child is secured in the seat properly by ensuring that the car seat harness straps are snug enough to hold your child firmly in the event of an accident.Buckle your child in, making sure the harness straps aren\"t twisted, and then use the mechanism to pull the harness tight. You shouldn\"t be able to pinch any harness fabric between your fingers.Slide the plastic retainer clip that holds the two straps together up to armpit level before securing it. If the clip is too low, your child could be ejected from his seat in a crash.When you\"re putting your child in his seat, double-check to be sure that the seat is buckled tightly to the car. Forward-facing safety seats come with a strap so you can tether the seat to an anchor point in the car for extra protection.Set a good example by always wearing your own seat belt.If you see someone driving around with their children not in a car seat or safely buckled up, call 0861 400-800 with the car’s license plate and the date and the RTMC will send them a warning letter. It could save a child\"s life."

        "description": "",
        "content": "For many women, breaking the glass ceiling is the ultimate but for Deshun Deysel, it goes even further – it’s conquering mountains, literally! She went from being a teacher to becoming one of the country’s leading female mountaineers. Deshun has been on 16 major climbing expeditions to five continents, including being part of the first group of South Africans to plant the new democratic flag on top of Mount Everest. Deshun is now busy building her business – Go Peak International. But she has her eye on the Seven Summits and maybe even the Three Poles. She spoke to media personality Uveka Rangappa about Fearlessly conquering it all. 1. As a mountaineer, you must have had to overcome many terror-filled moments. Which was your Fearless first?I think my first real fearful time was having to navigate the IceFall on Mount Everest. The IceFall is a notoriously volatile section on Everest, where many people have fallen to their deaths or been seriously injured. The deep crevasses mean you are constantly looking down into the hole that could swallow you up or looking up at an ice block that could collapse on top of you! Overcoming that in your mind in order to continue climbing is a real victory in itself. 2. You were a teacher. What led you to mountain climbing?  I’d been teaching for six years when the opportunity to sign up for the First South African Mount Everest Expedition came up. As a little girl, I always followed all the ‘Everest/Adventure Specials’ by National Geographic and I was obsessed with Tintin and Heidi’s adventures! I ended up backpacking through Europe and hiking SA’s iconic spots, like the Blade River Canyon back in the early 1990s. It all led to me being part of that historic 1996 Expedition to Everest. 3. You didn’t make it all the way to the top of Mount Everest then, but you keep trying. What keeps you going?  I love climbing and I love reaching the top even more! In mountaineering, you learn that you must try a number of times before you can finally claim your spot at the top. It’s an important life lesson. Mount Everest has played such a strong role in shaping my identity, so it would be the ultimate reward for a lifelong pursuit. I can’t wait to get back there! 4. You’ve also had to fight stereotypes. Tell us about that.  When I first set foot on these big mountains, there was literally not a single other Black person, anywhere! As a woman, I also found myself having to overcome primitive ideas around my capability, strength and hunger for climbing. I have been bullied, mentally abused and often felt like there was a deliberate attempt to stop me from succeeding. It is a tough thing to experience under normal circumstances, but when you’re climbing a big mountain for weeks and weeks, the stakes are much higher.5. Do you draw on your mountain climbing experiences to deal with challenges in business?  I draw on the lessons I’ve learnt in climbing daily and try to lead my team to a similar understanding. I also take our customers on ‘virtual/simulated journeys’ to tackle their own ‘Everests.’6. Has mountaineering made you more resilient or were you always resilient which is why you’ve chosen to conquer mountains?  I would say that I was already resilient. I was quite ill as a child and also dealt with abuse, so I started climbing with a high level of tenacity. However, the mountains have tested me in greater ways than life sometimes does and I’ve grown really tough as a result. Mountaineering makes one resourceful and helps tremendously with a sense of risk calculation and being calm when there is danger. Amazingly, it helps in my parenting as well.7. You’re an active promoter of high altitude climbing among women in Africa… how have you seen these experiences change the women you’ve worked with?  In 2020, I was part of an All Woman team heading to climb Mount Everest. COVID put a stop to that, but it was a signal that women are starting to take up space in the mountains. I’m quite pleased that my small steps a few decades ago have brought mountaineering into focus for women in Africa. Of course, many women have done greater climbs than me in recent years, which brings me a great deal of joy!"

That’s who Annelee Murray was for 20 years.  Annelee was the Public Relations (PR) machine behind the team – working with 7 national coaches, 248 players and 21 Springbok captains – a role that earned her the title of “First Lady of Springbok Rugby”. To many of the players she is affectionately known as the “Mother of the Springboks” and as a “lioness who would rear her head to sort out anyone who was unkind to one of her boys”. Annelee documents her green and gold journey with the team in her book, THE FIRST LADY OF SPRINGBOK RUGBY. She tells media personality Uveka Rangappa how she fearlessly played in a field many think is reserved for men!You spent 20 years doing PR for the Springboks and became known as the First lady of Springbok Rugby.  It couldn’t have been easy surrounded by all that testosterone. Looking back, what was your fearless first and how did you get past it?Initially,  I was slightly intimidated addressing Springbok greats but I just got stuck in and worked harder and smarter and gained the respect of my colleagues and the players. I never felt I had to overcome anything, just be better and awesome at my job.Back to the beginning – why rugby?I always loved sport and still do and wanted to work in sport. The rugby opportunity came along and I grabbed it with both hands.Was it difficult being a woman in the middle of this “scrum”? Were you ever not taken seriously or second-guessed?I quickly learnt that I had to be better than anyone in my job and I worked harder than I’d ever done to gain the respect.What do you think you brought to the role that a man couldn’t?I think naturally woman have empathy and that helped me, along with my nurturing nature.Did it change you – make you tougher or did you stay “you”? I learnt to be tougher and how to say NO in a nice way. Being the gatekeeper in this high profile male sports environment was hard but I developed a tough “outer layer”.What were the demands and rewards of the job?The demands were long hours, relentless pressure and expectation of a nation but the rewards were the winning and bringing a nation together.Who/where do you think you would have been if you hadn’t taken this path?  I think I would have been just another proud supporter of the team, as I am now since retirement.Many women might be intimidated by such a role in what can be described as a “man’s world” – they might not even take the job – what do say to those women?I would say that you need to back yourself in any situation and hope that by sharing my journey I can inspire many people regardless of gender, to achieve.You’ve finally documented your green and gold journey in this book – what next for Annelee Murray?I’m enjoying being at home for longer than a few weeks , watching my vegetable garden grow and spending time with my loved ones . I hope to always be involved in sport in some way or another. "

        "heading": "Prioritise women entrepreneurs to break the bias",
        "description": "",
        "content": "Women are more likely than men to choose entrepreneurship, not because they have a burning passion or the right skills, but because of a lack of better opportunities.  This was confirmed by 46% female respondents in a recent survey conducted by 1st for Women Insurance which also found that 93% of the respondents have #girlboss or entrepreneur ambitions. In the survey, almost half (48%) of respondents felt that they are not provided with the same opportunities as men in a nine to five job. When asked what they would do if they were an entrepreneur, 30% said social media influencer, content creator or business consultant, 27% have their sights set on the food industry and 20% want to open an online business. 23% listed the ‘other’ category with hopes to one day open a beauty salon, become a singer, offer coding lessons to kids and be a taxipreneur, for example. These aspirations carry massive potential. In the US, the fastest-growing segment of start-up companies are women-owned businesses.  The reason?  To break free from social constraints, to achieve financial independence, to reduce the chance of being harassed or attacked and to have more control and influence over what happens in their lives.  In South Africa, the statistics are less encouraging, but improving.  In South Africa, women comprise only 19,4% of business owners and yet, according to research by Development Economics, women-owned businesses established between 2018 and 2022 may generate R175 billion a year and create 972 000 jobs. “The theme for International Women’s Day this year is Break the Bias and a way to do just that is to encourage, support and mentor female entrepreneurs so that challenges like gender inequality, opportunity inequality, bias, stereotypes, and discrimination are no longer an issue, says Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women.  Lauren Dallas, CEO of Future Females, a South African movement to inspire more female entrepreneurs, and better support their success, agrees.  “One of the best pieces of advice I received was that ‘those who push their way to the top of the mountain are rarely the ones that stand on top’.  For anyone and everyone with the influence and capacity to support those coming up behind them - that is our responsibility.  We are not fighting for equality to then make it equally hard for those coming up after us - we are clearing the path for the next wave of female activists, entrepreneurs, changemakers, to summit,” says Dallas. Future Females offers the following advice to women wanting to make a fearless fresh start: Just start! It\"s impossible to feel confident in an idea - an idea can\"t make money, only a business can.  So don\"t wait until you feel 100% confident, because that day is unlikely to come - just accept that this is the beautiful ambiguity of entrepreneurship, and start taking action.Entrepreneurship is a team sport - spend time finding your people!  Networking is one of the most important activities you can do for your business - when I first started Future Females, I had zero network in South Africa.  I spent hours each day reaching out to people on LinkedIn, and committed to having a coffee each day with someone I didn\"t know.Solve a problem - people will pay in proportion to the amount of pain you can help them resolve - so whatever your idea or business is, know exactly how it will add value for people, and for who.  Instead of a fear of failure, embrace a healthy fear of regret.  You have so much more to lose with not trying, than with putting yourself out there.  Start today, and just see what can happen in one week, one month, one year. “Breaking the Bias is all about passionately speaking out.  It’s the perfect mantra for those wishing to call out inequality in a nine to five, or play a part in creating a more diverse and inclusive future.  For aspiring entrepreneurs, the best way to become your own boss is to start a side hustle and build your income while you still have the safety of your day job.  Again, just start!” concludes van Wyngaard."

        "content": "Women all over the world are doing some simply amazing things. We’re taking on more leadership roles and have had such an impact on global economic growth in recent years that the terms “Women Economy” and “womenomics” have been coined. The Economist reports that women are fulfilling various roles in the workplace, such as manufacturing, exporting, investing, entrepreneurs, and management, and we’re doing it with skill and determination. Perhaps the most gratifying part of the women economy, though, is that it is growing, and this emerging awesomeness is coming from girls and women all over the world. The Economist also mentions that in schools, girls consistently get better grades, and in most developed countries, women make up more than half of university graduates. Considering that investing in the education of girls is one of the soundest investments developing countries can make, these achievements are the proof that girls and women are key drivers of growth. It is because of this important Women Economy that 1st for Women is taking an active part in developing and helping the women of South Africa in becoming all they’re capable of and more. In September 2015, 1st for Women and DESTINY joined our awesome female powers together to host an inspiring, motivating, and uplifting workshop for the women of South Africa. The 1st for women Leaderex Entrepreneur Workshop was our way of giving our smart local businesswomen the opportunity to network and learn valuable business lessons from some of SA’s most successful women entrepreneurs. In addition to hosting the workshop, we wanted to take a personal hand in the Women Economy to help women thrive and be the best business people they can be. We partnered with LEAP to give one lucky attendee the chance to win R1million Director’s &amp; Liability Business cover, a three-month, face-to-face mentoring programme with a prominent businesswoman, and marketing for her business worth R50, 000. The winner would also be featured in the December 2015 issue of Destiny Magazine. We are pleased to announce that Jolene Roelofse, managing director of marketing and communications firm BluDoor Market, is our deserving winner of the Innovate and Grow competition! After speaking to Jolene, it’s clear why she is the deserving winner of this prize; when asked where she sees herself in three years’ time, she responded, “I’d like to be leading a team of self-motivated people who want to change the world through creativity and innovation.” This spirit of driven and enthusiastic entrepreneurship is what makes the Women Economy tick, which is good for everyone. Indeed, on a global scale, Mckinsey reports that if men and women played equal and identical roles in the labour market, a whopping $28 trillion, or 26 per cent, could be added to the global GDP, and on a business scale, UN Women reports that equality in the economy is great for business – companies that increase leadership opportunities for women increase their effectiveness. We are thrilled to help entrepreneurial women like Jolene achieve their dreams and determine a future that will be a better place for all people."

        "description": "",
        "content": "There is something powerful and meaningful about women friendships that energises us, challenges us in all the best ways, and makes us better people for them. If you’ve got a best friend, you probably already know just how much better you feel when you’ve had a good belly laugh with her, or how your worries can feel insignificant when you’ve talked out your problems. Even when you fight, you know that you’ll be able to sort it out.If you’re lucky enough to have a best friend, there is a range of mental and physical benefits you’re getting from her that you probably didn’t even know about! Read on to find out what they are: Health benefits Did you know that when your best friend makes you laugh until you cry, it’s actually good for your health? According to the Mayo Clinic, laughter has a number of short- and long-term benefits. When you laugh, you inhale more oxygen, which stimulates your lungs, heart and muscles. It also stimulates your brain to release endorphins, which are known as the body’s natural painkillers, and they have similar effects to those of morphine. In addition to this, laughter can help to relax you, strengthen your immune system, lessen the effects of depression, and help you connect with other people. Boosted cancer survival rates  A small study conducted in 2005 observed 61 women who had advanced ovarian cancer. The results of the study suggested that there were higher levels of a certain protein marker that is associated with a poorer prognosis in women who had weaker social bonds. That weekly catch-up that you and your best friend enjoy could have more positive effects than either of you imagined! Honesty  Honesty is important in every relationship, and your best bud will give it to you even when you don’t want to hear it, because she knows when you need to hear it. Whether you’re talking about your partner, a big career move, or what you’re wearing, you know you can always count on her to tell you the truth. Improved self-confidence  Low self-esteem can have a negative impact on your mental well-being. Indeed, it can make it difficult to complete even the simplest tasks, such as obtaining insurance quotes when you know you really need them, or going to the gym to work out. But when you’ve got a friend that can be honest, real and supportive with you, your self-confidence will soar. Sometimes, when you’re having a bad day and feeling pretty low, a kind word from your best friend can make you feel on top of the world again. You feel understood  There are times when the only thing you need is for someone to say, “I understand,” and validate your feelings. Even if she hasn’t experienced what you’re going through, she loves you so much that she can put herself in your position and empathise with how you’re feeling. And you can do the same for her, which is what friendship is really about. Your best friend also knows you inside-out – possibly more than any other person on the earth, and when you’re going through something, she knows just what to say to make you feel better. Often, you don’t even need to tell her how you’re feeling; she already knows. Be more independent  Our friends often encourage us to try new things, whether it’s to simply eat at a restaurant we’ve never been to or to take up a new hobby. By doing things that are different and out of our comfort zones, our friends encourage us to be more independent and adventurous. Now that you’ve read about all the wonderful things you and your best friend do for each other without even realising it, share the love and send this blog to her!"

        "content": "Have you noticed that when you make a small mistake, you’re quick to admonish yourself for it, but when you have a win, you often don’t make as big a deal of it? Don’t you think that’s strange? Women often don’t take the credit for what they do for themselves and those around them, and if you don’t give yourself the credit you deserve, you’re doing yourself a disservice in so many ways. By failing to recognise the value you add to your world, you may be holding yourself back from opportunities. If you don’t appreciate your value, you are less likely to feel motivated and confident in your ability and therefore less likely to take advantage of opportunities that come your way so that you can lead the life you want to. Teresa Amabile from The Harvard Business School analysed 12 000 diary entries from 238 employees across seven companies, and discovered something interesting: tracking people’s motivation is the key to boosting confidence and achieving future success. The reason for this is because accomplishing something releases dopamine in our brains, which makes us feel good. And this leads us to seek out that reward again so we get the same feeling. This counts even if the achievement is small, meaning that even the little victories can lead to great success. Take a moment to reflect on who you are and what it is that you’ve done. You may be surprised to find that you are so much more than you think you are and have done so much more than you thought you could. So what is holding you back? You have this inherent, strength, resolve and power to do what you want to do and be who you want to be. Start by recognising your value and then put the steps in place, no matter how small they may be, so that the little wins turn into the life changing results. But, and this is a big caveat, that doesn’t mean that we should always be striving to do and be more. Women are adopting a new normal that is less about fulfilling external expectations of perfection and more about making it work on their own terms, and this is unique to each woman out there. We want women to have the confidence to embrace this. At 1st for Women, we’d like to start off by letting you know just how amazing you are for just being you. And while you are thinking about what other steps you need to take, we’d like to join you on your journey and provide you with some of the support you may need to get there, through:Savings: If, on your journey, you need to save, remember that with 1st for Women, you can save around R422pm* on your premiums.The Foundation: We know how you love to help others, which is why a percentage of your monthly premium goes to the 1st for Women Foundation which helps survivors of gender-based violence and cervical cancer.Guardian Angels: If your journey means that you have very little time to do what needs to be done and you need that extra pair of hands, remember that we give you the Guardian Angeles Lifestyle Assistance service that helps you move forward in life. These benefits are offered to all Car, Home Contents and Buildings Insurance clients.Terms and conditions apply."

        "content": "Are you a mother, daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, friend or colleague? Have you taken the time to reflect and acknowledge just how great a contribution you make? How much value you add and what your impact is on so many different people’s lives? 1st for Women recently conducted research which highlighted that women are expected to perform at a high level on a continuous basis in all their roles. This constant pressure sometime stops them from seeing just how great they are and what an excellent job they’re doing, not just for their families, friends and colleagues, but for themselves, too. To bring this insight to life, we conducted a social experiment with a group of mothers and their daughters. A beautiful story and a common theme unfolded which confirms that women often don’t take credit for what they have achieved in all their roles, and instead, attribute their success to someone else. To see this, click here. Through this story and our research, we highlight that women are balancing a number of different responsibilities and expectations. Some days they can do it all, others not, and that’s OK. Today, it’s about making their realities work for them on their own terms. Regardless of the situation, that extra support and a reminder of their inner strength when they need it most can never go amiss. We believe that the world would be a much better place if more women were encouraged to let their inherent confidence shine. It’s not about being self-centred, but rather about inspiring women to live up to their own unique potential, acknowledging and celebrating their successes, and how this means something different for each woman. We know that you do so much for so many and don’t always put yourself first. That’s why, in all that 1st for Women does, we aim to be the consistent reminder of your inner greatness. We aim to put you first."

        "description": "",
        "content": "If you’ve ever watched Oprah’s popular TV talk show, you’ll know what an ‘aha moment’ is. This is one of her favourite expressions, and she uses it when she has an epiphany that is so enormous, it’s life changing. Everyone experiences aha moments from time to time, whether it’s realising that you need to forgive someone, or having a business idea that is so genius, you wonder how no one has thought of it before. But acting on personal aha moments is vastly different to acting on business ideas. Starting your own business involves a lot of risk to you, your family, your finances, your relationships, your time, and just about every other aspect of your life. If you’ve had a life-changing idea but you’re losing sleep wondering where you’ll get the capital, time, and even the courage to turn it into a business, here’s how you can make your dreams a reality and contribute your wonderful idea to the world! Believe in yourself The first step is to believe in yourself. Remember: you have something that no one else has – you. Your guts, your wisdom, your experiences. When you feel that the responsibility and risk of a start-up is too much, believe in and remind yourself of all of your unique, outstanding abilities. You know more than you think you do, and you’re capable of more than you think you are. Use whatever tools you can The internet has given entrepreneurs the ability to reach millions of people at relatively low cost, so there are more opportunities for budding entrepreneurs than ever before. If you need to produce a prototype, you can get dozens of quotes online in a matter of days. You can advertise on Google and decide how much you’d like to spend. You can create a social media account for free and create brand love and build-up around your product before it’s even launched. By using all tools at your disposal, you give your exciting idea its best chance of working. Hold on to that feeling  When your idea came to you, it probably filled you with enthusiasm and made you feel exhilarated just thinking about all the ways it could make a difference to the world. Grab that feeling and don’t let go! It’s that zeal that will continue to drive you later on if things get tough. Use it to propel you to great moments and to push you through low times. And remember that, by satisfying a need or desire for people, you’re helping to make their lives better, so always remember that you are doing something good for the world. Be patient  Very few entrepreneurs turn a profit or make their company a success instantly. It can take years of hard work before you see the fruits of your efforts. But remember that a business can be a lifelong undertaking, so give it the time it needs to grow, and enjoy the journey of learning along the way. Make others believe  No one will ever know or love your idea as much as you do, but you can use your passion for it to make others believe in it and you. This is true whether you’re selling it to customers or investors; if you can make others understand what it’s all about and help them share even a fraction of your passion, the hardest part is done. Cut yourself some slack  No matter what stage of life you’re in, it can be scary to start your own business venture. And if you’re supporting a family, taking the leap can be even more daunting. If, at any time, you feel like you’re failing or that you’re not good enough, remember all the wonderful things you do on a day-to-day basis. All of those ‘little’ things you do, like pack the school lunches or comfort a heartbroken friend, and all of the roles you take on – employee, businesswoman, daughter, mother, wife, sister, friend, decision-maker, companion, chef, student, manager, teacher – are proof that you are capable of more than you think you are. Actually, thanks to a survey by McKinsey, we can now put a monetary figure on the tremendous work that women do worldwide that we don’t get paid for, and it’s roughly $12 trillion. You’re a part of that massive global effort! Get business insurance  It’s important to cover your business should something happen; you don’t want one small mistake to wreck the enterprise that you put so much effort and love into. There are many ways that business insurance can protect you, and what cover you need will largely depend on what product or service you’re selling. Whatever innovative idea you have, 1st for Women will support you while you turn it into a successful business. We’ll take care of the things like your business insurance, so that you can focus on making your dreams a reality."

        "description": "",
        "content": "No matter what stage you’re at in your life, there is one person that you should always be able to trust in and rely on – you. But as women, we find ourselves fulfilling multiple roles for our friends, partner, children, parents, siblings, and colleagues, whether it’s sorting out car insurance for our ageing parents or skipping a day’s work to spend time with a friend who really needs emotional support, we frequently neglect the significant relationship that we should be having with ourselves. With all of the crazy, hectic moments that make up our day-to-day lives, it’s important to still find ways to stay true to ourselves. Here are our 1st for Women tips on maintaining the ever-important relationship with yourself: 1. Forgive your mistakes  “The past is where you learn the lesson. The future is where you apply the lesson.” –Unknown. You’re human, and realising that it’s OK to make mistakes can be incredibly liberating. Indeed, one of the best ways to grow and learn new things is to make mistakes. It’s also one of the best ways to learn more about yourself. When you slip-up, you learn your limitations and often, if you pick yourself up and try again, you surprise yourself with how much further you can go or how much better you are at something than you believed. Mistakes also teach you how to forgive, not only yourself, but those around you, too. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and that these are not just a part of life; they help us to grow and become better people. So the next time you stumble, say, “It’s OK,” to yourself, learn from it, and you’ll be a better person for it. 2. Pamper yourself and know you deserve it  Modern women often find themselves fulfilling selfless roles. It’s a good thing to sometimes put your family, work, or friends first, but not all the time. It’s important for your mental, physical and emotional wellness to occasionally think of your own needs before you think of others’. You probably know this and yet you may often struggle to give yourself that 30-minute pamper session, or to take a five-minute break from work, or to splash out and buy yourself something that you know you deserve. Doing things like this doesn’t need to cost a lot of money – it could just be buying a new book from your favourite author. But every now and then, go ahead and do something that is just for you. 3. Keep promises you make to yourself  Whether it’s New Year’s resolutions or simply telling yourself that this weekend you’ll make time to play the piano, when you renege on those little promises to yourself, you lose your own trust; it’s like telling yourself that you don’t value yourself, which inevitably harms your self-esteem. Try to make promises to yourself that are practical and attainable, that you know you’re not likely to go back on. 4. Take responsibility for your actions  If you do something wonderful at work, own it. If you make a mistake, claim it. But whatever happens, take responsibility for your actions – the good and the bad. By showing others that you’re a reliable person who holds her own actions accountable, you’re showing yourself the same thing, and you’ll be a person you can be proud of. 5. Sincerely compliment yourself  Every morning when you wake up, or every evening before you go to sleep, compliment yourself. Whether it’s a mental high five for owning that important presentation, or simply to tell yourself that you’re proud you stood up for yourself, recognise your uniqueness and love it. 6. Stick to your values no matter what  This is one of the most difficult things for any person to do, to stand up and say that you don’t agree with something, even when everyone else is not on your side. Yes, it is hard, and yes, it may make you unpopular, but if you stand up for your beliefs, you can place your head on your pillow each night and feel proud, knowing that you can have faith in yourself to do the right thing. 7. Trust your gut  There is nothing wrong with turning to friends, family or mentors when you need direction on an important decision in your life, but sometimes, your best guide is your gut. If your sixth sense is screaming at you, don’t stifle it – listen! You know yourself, what you want, and what you need better than anyone else. 8. Love yourself and embrace your uniqueness  “Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You.” – Dr. Seuss. Although Dr Seuss is best known for writing children’s books, adults can take some important lessons from his words, too. Being you is something to love and celebrate; you have talents and qualities that absolutely no one on earth can replicate, and that’s all the reason you need to love and stay true to yourself. At 1st for Women, we embrace your uniqueness and have tailor-made our products to help you live on their own terms each day. From comprehensive car insurance to life insurance, we offer you cover that is designed just for you."

        "heading": "6 ways to get that new job or promotion ",
        "description": "",
        "content": "If you’re a career woman, you’re always looking onwards and upwards. You work hard to advance your career, and if there is no chance for growth in your company, you’ll likely look for a new job somewhere else. But sometimes you can get looked over for a job or promotion even though you know you’re the best person for it. Your skills alone may not be enough because there are loads of things that contribute to how people perceive you and, ultimately how likely you are to get a job or promotion. If you don’t want to be skipped over the next time a promotion comes around or your dream job opens up, read our 6 tips to get the position that you know you deserve: 1. Keep abreast of industry changes  There are few industries that are not directly affected by technology and developments at least once every few years. Whether new technology is introduced or laws change, it’s highly unlikely your job will stay the same forever. By keeping up with these changes, you’re showing your boss or future employers that you know what’s going on in your industry, which earns you more credibility. 2. Set goals and make them clear If you’re driven to excel in your career, define exactly what you’re after and on what timeline. If you want to be in top management, do you know how you’re going to get there? What positions must you hold to reach that point? How old do you want to be when you reach this position? Setting goals can make reaching them much easier because you know exactly what you’re working towards. And remember to tell your boss or your future employer what your intentions are. If you don’t, you may be passed over simply because no one knows what you want. 3. Research/homework  Doing your homework on what the new job entails will go a long way towards attaining it. If you feel that you’re not quite qualified for the position, you have one of two options – you can abandon the idea of going for it, or you can work to gain the skills you need. But no matter what, never deceive your employer or interviewer about what you are capable of. 4. Go the extra mile  Doing more than only what is in your job description will grab the attention of the powers that be. For example, if you’re a personal assistant and you hear your boss talking about how she needs new, business insurance, taking the initiative to get her quotes will not only impress her, but make her life easier. 5. Ask for it!  “The difference between your dreams and reality is called action.” – Unknown If you wait for a promotion, you may never get one. Likewise, the only way to get a new job is to apply for one. If you know someone who may be able to get you a foot in the door for a position, ask. The worst that can happen is they’ll say, “No.” 6. Believe in yourself  This is not a cheesy piece of advice. If you want others to think that you are capable of doing the new job well, you need to believe it yourself! If you doubt your own abilities, you’ll never convince others of them. Simply knowing that you’re good at what you do puts you squarely in line for that new job or promotion. 1st for Women Insurance understands the unique needs of career women, stay-at-home mums, and business owners, which is why we offer tailor-made vehicle, household, personal, and business insurance for all South African women."

        "description": "",
        "content": "As a working woman have you ever been labelled aggressive when you were trying to be assertive? Perhaps you were not able to stand up for yourself while someone else took credit for your work? Or have you been accused of being overly-ambitious when you’re just trying to get ahead?The past several decades have seen many global changes to the workforce and the modern business environment.  In South Africa, women now comprise about 39% of the workforce and occupy about 11 % of top managerial positions.“There’s still a long way to go before we break through the glass ceiling,” says Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance Brokers, “but there are ways to increase your chances of success in your career.”Increasing workplace skillsIt’s been proved that assertive women are more successful at accumulating resources and more likely to bring about positive change.  They manage to overcome adversity and emerge with greater strength than before. “Many people tend to think that business success is about being rational and logical - mostly seen as being male attributes,” explains Farrell, adding, “ but actually the human element is critically important - one of the major soft skills you can develop is assertiveness.”What exactly is assertiveness? It’s being able to express your thoughts, beliefs and feelings in a confident, open and honest way. It increases self-confidence and facilitates the communication of ideas at work. Being assertive isn’t just a matter of survival in the workplace, but an indirect and very powerful tool to increase productivity and efficiency.“Learning to be assertive is essential when standing up for yourself in certain situations like putdowns and asking for a raise. It’s a skill that is not only crucial for the workplace, but for our personal life as well,” affirms Farrell.Assertiveness vs Aggressivenes“Being assertive can be difficult especially for women, even in these modern times. Many women have been taught to be agreeable, passive, and polite, to avoid conflict and to make those around them feel at ease - even submissive.  But, this isn’t the way to achieve any of your goals,” says FarrellAssertive individuals communicate confidently, use constructive feedback, try to understand others and acknowledge the value others bring. They are able to be sensitive to others while still standing up for their own rights. “It’s about aiming for a win-win solution without allowing yourself to be pushed around,” adds Farrell.The six main characteristics of assertive communication are eye contact, non-intimidating body posture, appropriate gestures, a well-modulated voice and good timing which will all maximise the impact of your message.  How, when and where you choose to comment is probably even more important than what you say.An assertive woman deals with a stressful situation seeking resolution using direct, appropriate and honest forms of communication. She is open, polite, has good self-esteem, and seeks to build other’s self-esteem. As a boss, she leads by example, but never seeks, nor avoids confrontation. She is flexible, well respected and asks for what she needs. Farrell says, “Occasionally assertiveness can seem hostile, but when it does that hostility is usually warranted. But remember that to people who still think that women are not equals, any woman who asserts her rights might be seen as aggressive.”On the other hand, aggressive people stand up for themselves at the expense of others responding with anger, sarcasm, loudness, forcefulness, hostility and humiliation.An aggressive woman may be self-centered and have low self-esteem that she boosts by putting others down. She becomes stressed and makes those around her stressed too.She is often abrasive and forces others to accept that she is right.  As a boss, she forces her ideas on others, has to be in control and will belittle those who disagree. She sticks rigidly to the rules, is insensitive to other’s needs and is resented and feared rather than respected. She demands rather than asks.The FuturePeople are the essence of business; whether they are managers or employees—and being an effective communicator is essential to success. Communicating assertively can mean the difference between closing a deal and losing it. It can also mean the difference between effectively leading a team or causing it to fail. Studies indicate that women are more likely than men to possess the leadership qualities associated with success. They are better listeners and stimulate others to think \"outside the box,\" making them more inspirational.“According to predictions, in the future, women leaders will dominate because they are better suited to 21st century leadership/management than men,” affirms Farrell. Having good people skills allows women to build strong relationships with others and enhance her career.Developing these skills will ensure that others trust, respect and admire you in the workplace."

        "heading": "Finding the balance between family and work",
        "description": "",
        "content": "For working women, so much of our lives are about juggling being a wife, primary care-giver and worker. This often means that we have very little time for ourselves and our families. If you’re a career-woman it’s very easy to get caught up in the rat race and find yourself working late at night and on weekends. But, it’s essential to find balance in your work and home life.So says Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance Brokers and mother of two young children.Breaking down the rolesResearch suggests that adult’s roles become even more traditional when they add children to their family. So, tasks become delegated by gender rather than by interest or ability. Managing all of these roles is a great source of stress and often also guilt for women.Farrell asserts, “Many families do need two wage earners in the family to pay all the bills - but there is a way to keep your career going and bring home the bacon without neglecting your own or your families needs.”   Some women are also the breadwinners or single parents increasing the stress of the situation.Spillover is when the conditions and relationships in one area of our lives affect us in another area. For example, inflexible work hours, an overbearing boss, or a less-than-positive work environment can have a negative impact on your family life.Family concerns, such as an unsupportive partner, inequities in the division of housework and child care, significant health problems in family members, or changing child care arrangements can have a negative impact on your work. “But, whatever the situation, there are some processes that you can go through to help you find more balance,” says Farrell, “for instance clarifying values, setting realistic goals and expectations, setting priorities, managing time and letting go control.” Finding the BalanceMake sure you manage your time properly. Disorganisation will lead to a less effective usage of time and neither part of your life will benefit from this. “Plan meals and shopping lists in advance so that you only need to shop once a week. Also, perhaps your partner can also do the shopping every other week so that you share this responsibility,” suggest Farrell. This would require you letting go of the idea that only you can do this task. Also, set aside any other chores that need to be done on the weekend which you can do together as a family.A job that requires long hours or excessive travel will probably have a negative impact on a partnership or parenting role. “If this is the case, perhaps you need to ask yourself some serious questions,” says Farrell. Some of these questions might include: Is this job really that important to me that I am willing to perhaps sacrifice the happiness of my family? Is there a way to cut my working hours but still keep my job even if that means earning less money? Is this situation temporary or permanent? Prioritising is a key component of finding balance. Make choices that empower you and the situation.Asking for help and allowing others to support you is a necessary step in gaining balance. Perhaps you can start a lift-scheme with another family who is at the same school. Or ask a granny to fetch from school and take to extra murals once a week. Make sure to have trusted help at home that you can rely upon to take care of your children’s’ needs when you are not around.Family Time“Being with family is not always about quantity of time but rather quality,” explains Farrell, “when you are with your children or husband, do your best to be present.” This means engaging with them and really listening to them without distractions so put your phone away and the television off. Also, don’t forget that all-important time alone with your partner—a date night is always a good idea. “Make the effort with each other even if you are tired,” adds Farrell.Planning and communication are central to all change. Other ideas to help balance work and family include: holding family meetings; keeping weekly or monthly schedules that schedule time for both concrete and relational goals; being willing to revise plans when they don’t work or changes need to be made; understanding what you can control and what you can’t, keeping a sense of humour and remembering that finding the balance is a continually evolving process."

But, if you don’t have a partner, Valentine’s Day can be more than just an irritation, it can bring on feelings of loneliness.“We need to keep this commercialised day in perspective,” advises Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance Brokers.The New Single   In bygone eras, it was thought that all women needed to be married by the age of 25 and if you weren’t, well then, you were considered to be left on the shelf. Women were conditioned to believe that without a man, their prospects were minimal as was their future happiness. How times have changed!“Today, women realise that marriage and having children and even being in a relationship is a choice—it is not dictated by society, but rather by each woman as an individual,” explains Farrell.Statistics show that in South Africa, 73% of women between the ages of 18 and 44 are in fact single and 68% of children are born to single moms.   What’s more, at least 14% of women in this country believe marriage to be outdated.Women have cottoned onto the fact that they are happier alone than in a toxic relationship and that they do not need to be committed to someone to feel fulfilled or “complete” or half of a whole. You are whole all by yourself!Valentine’s Day is a good day to remind yourself that you live by your own rules and are empowered in your own life. If when Valentine’s Day rolls around, you would like to be in a relationship, then use the day as a catalyst to formulate a plan of action to reach your goal. For instance, make a list of potential places to meet someone and let friends know that you’re on the lookout and open for blind dates.Many people end meeting their love match through friends, or friends of friends or even on the Internet. Stats show that 50% of women subscribe to online dating which has a 50/50 gender split. Find out what\"s happening in the singles scene, go out and have a great time, discover some new people to talk to and share cocktails without any expectations. “And do always remember,” says Farrell, “there’s no shame in being single.”Get Some PerspectiveIf you still feel a bit sniffly come Valentine’s Day – perhaps you’ve just broken up with someone—remind yourself that many couples find the day pointless and don’t celebrate it at all.Farrell adds, “Couples messaging is very strong but just because someone is in a relationship, it does automatically mean that they are happy just because they’re paired off.”After all, divorce statistics show that 50% of all marriages will end.  Many single people are extremely content but it’s just not fashionable to cover the happiness of singledom.  “Rather than feeling down on Valentine\"s Day, celebrate your strengths and achievements as a person who has space for love should it come along but who does not need such a relationship to create self-worth and happiness,” says Farrell. Another way to deal with the day is to treat yourself.  Why not book yourself into a spa? Or indulge in a box of chocolates? If you’ve got the blues, take on some exercise to get those endorphins rushing. Make it a day to pamper and celebrate you.Single or unattached, we can all fall into a habit of not acknowledging the people who matter in our life. “Use Valentine\"s Day as a reminder to spend the rest of the year letting people know how much they mean to you,” advises Farrell. Sometimes, the most difficult thing about Valentine’s Day is the sheer preponderance of love messaging suggesting that you need to hurry or you\"ll risk missing the boat. Many romances spark throughout people\"s lives, at any age. In the meantime, love the life you\"re living and don\"t live for love. Farrell affirms, “Don\"t rush before you\"re absolutely ready to commit; enjoy this single time now or for as long as you intend it to last.”"

        "content": "We all know the drill: time is precious and there just never seems to be enough of it. Between work, kids and making time for family, friends and yourself, life can be pretty chaotic.In fact, research shows that more than two thirds of women feel that they don’t have enough hours in the day.“Time management is a skill that we’re often not born with but really need to learn,” explains Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance Brokers, adding, “that skill can go a long way in making life less stressful and in creating more time for the things that matter.”But, how do you do this?Give Up Control There are various ways in which we can manage our time better. Firstly, ladies, let’s get real. The idea of the “superwoman” who can shuttle her kids up and down to extra-murals, do their homework with them, climb the corporate ladder, make sure her roots are done as well as be a domestic Goddess in the kitchen is so passé.“The truth is that at various times in your life, you have to prioritise what’s most important to achieve for you right now. And this may change several times during your life,” affirms Farrell.You need to make a list of what’s most important to you right now. Is it being with your kids in the afternoons? Is it making sure that your family is financially secure? If it’s both, then assign a certain number of hours to each of these priorities and see how you can make it work for you. If your boss cannot allow you the flexibility you need, then perhaps it’s time to start looking around for something else or taking the leap and starting your own business. Perhaps you need to focus on being healthy and fulfilled—how best can you achieve that? If you need to spend more time on friendships, then at the beginning of each week, make sure to assign an hour for lunch or dinner with one of your best friends-- and stick to it.Cut The WeedsThink of weeds as anything non-essential to creating a content and happy life. Weeds do not add value to your existence but they take up a lot of space in your garden. They may come in the form of toxic friendships that have run their course, negative relationships, chores and family obligations. You’d be surprised at how much time they actually suck up.“It’s not saying that you can shun all family obligations, but be choosy about what you will and won’t do. There’s no point agreeing to see people who you don’t actually like or waste energy and time engaging in activities that don’t add value to your life,” says Farrell.Get HelpThere are a myriad of ways in which you can cut the time you spend on chores. The growth of the internet means that often very little extra charge, you can do things like order your groceries online, books travel plans and bank online. Those doctor’s appointments that you keep putting off, or having that broken window fixed can actually be done much more easily if you know where to get help.  “We’ve created Concierge Assist and Entertainment Assist, lifestyle management services with busy women like you in mind,” says Farrell, adding, “Concierge Assist can help with arrangements such as booking a car service, flights, accommodation, events, entertainment car hire, tourist information, restaurant bookings, party venues, handymen, a dentist visit and much more. “Also, don’t be afraid to delegate tasks to the rest of your family: grannies that can fetch from school and sometimes take to extra lessons. It’s okay not to be able to manage everything all the time and asking for help and support if you can is a valuable tool,” says Farrell."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Whether it’s an ankle boot, biker boot, knee-high riding boot, combat-style lace up or the must-have wedge - putting your best foot forward this winter could impair your driving capability.Based on studies done overseas, 1st for Women Insurance Brokers advises ladies that wearing restrictive, obstructive or improper footwear could cause them to have an accident.“Wearing tight or high-fitting boots that restrict leg movement or boots with thick soles or high heels can affect your driving ability. Without complete freedom of movement, your reaction time to brake or accelerate could be slowed. Similarly, obstructive soles and heels could result in you stepping on the accelerator and brake at the same time, or the push the wrong pedal entirely. Essentially, your ability to maintain control of your vehicle is compromised,” says 1st for Women’s managing director, Robyn Farrell.According to Farrell, one of the largest car insurance companies in the United Kingdom conducted a survey of 1 200 woman which showed that about 15% had lost control of their cars due to wearing boots with thick soles. The UK insurer also warned against heavily-padded jackets, which could hamper movement while driving, as well as hand gloves, which could cause a driver to lose traction on the steering wheel.“We conducted a mini-survey to gauge how South African women feel about driving in boots and high heels and the majority thinks it’s a breeze!  One woman did admit to losing control of her car due to her inappropriate footwear and some said that they usually swop their fashionable footwear for flats when driving,” says Farrell.It’s not only boots with thick soles that female drivers need to be wary of. Another study done this year by Brake, a UK-based road safety charity, revealed that high heels are the cause of many car accidents involving women drivers. The study showed that more than 11.5 million women in the UK wear inappropriate shoes when they drive. Some UK insurers have gone as far as to refuse compensation to those who have had car accidents while wearing inappropriate footwear.Farrell says that you shouldn’t drive wearing your winter boots if:The soles are more than seven centimeters thick.The soles are too wide that you risk applying pressure to more than one pedal at once.They do not have sufficient grip on the soles and slip easily off the pedals.They restrict the movement of your ankles and the muscles in your legs because they are either too high or tight-fitting.They have high heels which hamper your ability to move between or apply pressure to pedals. Farrell concludes: “We all love our winter boots but be honest with yourself, if they hamper your ability to operate and control your car properly, don’t wear them when you drive. Instead, keep a pair of less bulky shoes in your car for when you’re driving and simply swap them for your boots when you arrive at your destination. It only takes a minute or two.”"

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance is making steady progress in its efforts to address gender based violence in Diepsloot by partnering with community development NGO, Afrika Tikkun.The 1st for Women Insurance Trust* recently awarded Afrika Tikkun* with a grant of R2-million to help break the vicious cycle of violence and abuse and deliver much-needed family support services in Diepsloot through a holistic network of partners.“Gender based and domestic violence is an escalating phenomenon in many townships. In Diepsloot, the problem is deeply-concerning, with hundreds of women subjected to horrible acts of violence on a daily basis. Unfortunately, it is difficult to gauge the full extent of gender-related crimes in Diepsloot because a lot go unreported and survivors often drop charges against their abusive partners.“Many survivors are disempowered by partners who alienate them from their families and other people, and most are not employed. Due to these circumstances, they are dependant on their partners and have no means of escape,” says Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance and a Trustee of the 1st for Women Insurance Trust.“Our programme reaches out to survivors by increasing awareness of gender-related and child abuse, and highlighting that there are alternatives. From there, we work to empower individuals with information and support so that they can build new and better lives. We do this through our Wings of Life centre in Diepsloot and by hosting workshops, door-to-door awareness campaigns and interventions.“With 1st for Women and our partners, we are able to extend scarce and necessary support services to empower survivors to change and improve the quality of their lives,” says Herby Rosenberg, the Executive Deputy Chairman at Afrika Tikkun.According to Farrell, most of the beneficiaries of the programme are women who come to the centre for counseling and various other services relating to abuse. These services are also extended to other members of their families.There are eight partners, including Afrika Tikkun, which collaborate strategically to deliver various, focused services as part of the Diepsloot programme. These include:National Children and Violence Trust, which provides counselling to survivors of gender-based violence and child abuse;Sonke Gender Justice, which is training Afrika Tikkun and the National Children and Violence Trust’s representatives in the implementation of a human rights framework;People Opposed to Women Abuse (POWA), which works with the programme’s partners to determine the Diepsloot community’s needs and develop appropriate strategies and training. POWA also provides survivors with access to safe houses;Childline, which works with Afrika Tikkun to raise awareness of abuse at Diepsloot schools and in the community;Teddy Bear Clinic, which deploys a senior Teddy Bear Clinic social worker works at the Afrika Tikkun centre in Diepsloot once a week to deal with cases of child abuse directly. Teddy Bear Clinic will also be training and mentoring local social workers, and will establish a forensic social worker service for abused children;Webber Wentzel which offers pro-bono legal services and training around legal issues, especially for women seeking justice;  Afrika Tikkun, which coordinates and manages the programme.Farrell says Afrika Tikkun, through its holistic model, is making sound and steady progress in its objective to give hope and lend support to abuse survivors.“This is an extremely important cause to which we are proud to be associated. We are heartened by the achievements made through the programme in emancipating women and children who have suffered abuse. Though there is a lot of ground to be covered, reports of just one women or child saved from abuse is a triumph,” says Farrell.* 1st for Women Insurance policyholders automatically donate a portion of their premiums to the 1st for Women Insurance Trust. The main goal of the 1st for Women Insurance Trust is to uplift, assist and empower the women of our country. Since its inception in 2005 the 1st for Women Insurance Trust has donated over R16 million to women-related causes and charity organisations. 1st for Women policyholders have a say as to which charity or organisation the Trust supports.  Gender Based Violence and Cancer affecting women are causes most voted for by 1st for Women Insurance policyholders.* Afrika Tikkun is an NGO that is dedicated to investing in education, health and social services for children, youth and their families through its community centres of excellence and strategic partnership.  Our aim is to produce a new generation of productive citizens."

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance is cautioning ladies to avoid storing valuable items, house keys and important documents in their cars as theft out of motor vehicles is on an upward trend. The insurer has experienced a slight increase in claims relating to theft out of cars between 2010/2011 and 2011/2012. This is after a considerable increase of 66.85% in 2009/2010. The latest SAPS crime stats show that theft out of motor vehicle incidents rose by 4.8% in the past year. According to Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance, “Items that are typically stolen from vehicles are usually small, easy to hide, and easy to sell-off or pawn. Goods that 1st for Women’s customers commonly report being stolen from their cars include laptops, iPads, cellphones, handbags, clothes, sun glasses and shopping bags filled with newly-bought or yet-to-be-unpacked items. However, it is not uncommon to receive claims for larger items such as golf clubs, laptops and car sound speakers.” Jamming vehicle remotes is becoming a more commonly-used modus operandi. However, Farrell says there are still many incidents of thieves simply smashing windows to break in. A lot of incidents occur while vehicles are parked at shopping centres and even hospital or gym parking lots “Our claims data suggests the same thing as the recent SAPS crime stats; theft out of motor vehicles is a common crime and incidence is rising. And, it’s costing car-owners and insurance companies a lot of money. “The ‘remote jamming’ scam is increasingly being used by criminals who watch their targets as they lock and leave their vehicles, and then use other remotes to interfere with the car-owners’ remote frequencies, preventing them from locking the cars. This puts victims in a tricky position when it comes to proving to their insurers that a theft actually took place because there are no signs of forced entry. Still, for the most part thieves still break into cars using force, and smash-and-grabs remain a symptom of our times. “The only way to prevent your valuables from being stolen out of your car is to avoid leaving them in it. Of course, it isn’t always possible to avoid carrying items of value in our cars. However, we can take care to only carry what is necessary, keeping it hidden from view, and then remembering to remove valuables on arriving out our destinations,” says Farrell. Farrell says many car-owners leave their house or office keys in their cars, which are also known to be stolen during vehicle break-ins. “Don’t leave in your car any keys or documentation that could lead a criminal to your home, or offer them insight into your identity or habits. This includes utility bills and bank statements. It is just asking for trouble,” she cautions. She concludes with this advice:"

        "content": "Men, as lovely as they are, err on the side of adrenaline. Some people call it impulsive and brave. 1st for Women Insurance calls it high risk.1st for Women Insurance’s new advertising campaign is based on this simple premise and creatively demonstrates why the insurance brand is able to charge premiums that reflect women’s lower insurance risks as drivers.“The old adage - men are from Mars and women are from Venus - allowed us to explore scenarios in which men do ridiculous, dangerous and short-sighted things. The result is humorous and highly entertaining.  We have no doubt that this campaign will continue to grow the brand which, since its launch in 2004, has captured the hearts and minds of thousands of South African women,” says Carl Louw, Executive Head of Upstream, 1st for Women’s marketing arm. The campaign was conceptualised by Black River FC. According to Suhana Gordhan, Creative Director of Black River FC:  “While our previous 1st for Women campaigns also focused on the idea that men are a higher risk than women and featured men reversing all the way to Cape Town and falling off cliffs, this campaign ups the ante with jets, darts, exploding fizzy drinks and lots more.”Directed by Anton Visser from Velocity Films, the new campaign breaks through the clutter as it is based on solid and unique insights and has compelling retail offers for women. “The creative translation of this insight allows female viewers to relate in some way. While the scenarios in the commerical are quite extreme, we all know a guy who has attempted something ridiculous or crazy just for kicks, a good laugh and a show of machismo. When you allow your audience to connect with your adverts, it encourages content that is worth remarking about.” says Gordhan.The TV campaign, which was launched on Women’s Day, has been expanded to include a comprehensive radio, print and online advertising campaign.

        "content": "During ‘Movember’, men around the world sprout moustaches to raise awareness for men’s health, specifically prostate cancer and other cancers that affect men. Women too are urged to pay attention to their health down-south as the incidence of cervical cancer is second only to breast cancer in South Africa, but it is the most common cancer affecting women in Sub-Saharan Africa. “Although cervical cancer is one of the most preventable types of cancers, it is disconcertingly common in South Africa and is the biggest cause of cancer-related deaths in women here. We believe it is becoming critically-important to increase women’s knowledge of cervical cancer and stress the importance of screening for prevention,” says Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance. 1st for Women Insurance has teamed up with Right to Care, an NGO that treats cervical cancer and infectious diseases, and has provided a grant of R450 000 towards a mobile cervical cancer screening unit which offers screening to women in the Thabo Mofutsanyane district in the Free State. 1st for Women Insurance also sponsors a mobile cervical cancer screening unit that services the Karoo. These mobile cervical cancer screening units assist women who are unable to visit distant clinics and assist overwhelmed clinics, who often cannot conduct Pap Smears due to understaffing issues. “We are also committed to doing what we can to raise awareness of cervical cancer through our own efforts*. With greater awareness and by encouraging women to undergo regular screenings, the impact of this disease on South Africa’s women could be reduced,” says Farrell. Globally, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women, after breast cancer, but it is the most common cancer in women in developing countries. In South Africa, one out of 35 women will develop cervical cancer, the leading cause of female cancer deaths. According to the Cancer Association of South Africa, cervical cancer claims the lives of more than 3 400 South African women each year. Black women are more than twice as likely as white women to develop cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is transmitted through sexual activity. There are about 100 known types of HPV, of which 15 can cause cervical cancer. Women can be infected with HPV at any time in their lives while they are sexually active, but most infections clear up on their own. When an infection persists, the risk of developing cervical cancer rises. Other risk factors, such as smoking, can act to increase the risk of cervical cancer among women infected with HPV. The best way to reduce the risk of cervical cancer is with regular screening. This is an important way of detecting early changes in cells of the cervix so that treatment can be given to prevent a cancer developing. It involves taking a sample of cells from the cervix, known as a Pap smear, and should be done annually. It is now also possible to vaccinate against most common cancer-causing strains of HPV. Catching and treating the disease early greatly improves prognosis and the chance of a cure. Unfortunately, a lot of South African women do not undergo regular screening for cervical cancer due to lack of awareness or because they can’t, or don’t know how to, access the necessary healthcare services. “We are pleased to partner with Right to Care on this very important initiative, and commend their efforts and the efforts of other organizations pushing cervical cancer screening in South Africa. “All women who are sexually active must make it a priority to know the state of their heath down-south,” concludes Farrell. * 1st for Women Insurance policyholders automatically donate a portion of their premiums to the 1st for Women Insurance Trust. The main goal of the 1st for Women Insurance Trust is to uplift, assist and empower the women of our country.

        "content": "In October 2011, on a day just like today, a 16-year old Johannesburg teenager was abducted, drugged and taken to a township in Cape Town. Her kidnappers raped her and told her that she would be forced to work as a prostitute. One of the lucky few, this brave young girl managed to escape her captors after two months and is now reunited with her family. She was a victim of human trafficking. Wikipedia defines human trafficking as the ‘trade in humans, most commonly for the purpose of sexual slavery, forced labour or for the extraction of organs or tissues.’ As you read this article there are more than 2.5 million victims of human trafficking worldwide. Countless men, women and children living lives of misery and suffering that few of us can even begin to imagine.  According to a 2012 report published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 55-60% of all trafficking victims globally are women and 75% women and girls together. Sexual exploitation accounts for 58% of all trafficking cases and forced labour 36%.  What happened to that Johannesburg teenager in 2011 is happening right now to a young girl somewhere in the world and in your own country. It is time to sit up and take action. The 1st for Women Trust is therefore pleased to note that President Jacob Zuma signed the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Bill last week, giving hope to the countless victims of human trafficking in South Africa.  According to The Presidency the signing of the bill gives South Africa a single statute with which to address human trafficking. ‘The new legislation also creates offences such as debt bondage, possession, destruction and tampering with travel documents and using the services of victims of trafficking, among others, all of which facilitate innocent persons becoming victims of this modern day form of slavery,’ it said in a statement.  Penalties for human trafficking offences are severe. The maximum penalty for trafficking in persons is R100 million or life imprisonment or both in the case of a conviction. Traffickers will also be forced to pay compensation to their victims.  The 1st for Women Trust aims to assist and empower the women of South Africa and applauds the enactment of the Prevention and Combating of Trafficking in Persons Bill.

        "content": "Glenda* was a 16-year-old single mother when she met Adam*. He was charismatic, intensely interested in her and swept her off her feet. Little did she know that this relationship would strip her of her self-worth and leave her physically and emotionally broken. This is Glenda’s story and the story of thousands of other women like her who struggle to break free of abusive relationships. Glenda had been a straight-A student before she fell pregnant at 16. The father of her child left her, leaving her alone and vulnerable. Then she met Adam and fell in love, believing that they could build a future together. She was determined to make a success of the relationship.  But then Adam started to behave in ways that worried Glenda. He was possessive and started to criticise her friends and family. To keep the peace, Glenda distanced herself from the people she loved the most. Then, one day, he hit her.  This was the start of a 36-year cycle of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Glenda was isolated from her friends and family and had nowhere to turn. Adam told her that the abuse was her fault, that no other woman had ever provoked such a reaction from him and that she ‘had no soul’. Although she knew what he was doing was wrong, she couldn’t leave him. She really felt that it was her fault that she provoked such anger and that she ‘must be a terrible person’. Why it is hard to leave Isolation, victim-blaming and humiliation are classic characteristics of an abusive relationship. They can result in a condition known as battered woman syndrome, when a woman’s self-esteem has taken such a knock that she does not believe she will be able to cope on her own outside of the relationship. She finds it impossible to leave, or if she does leave, always comes back - largely due to the manipulation, charm and promises of the partner. “It was very difficult to leave because I had started to believe that I was the ugliest, stupidest, least interesting person around – and one with no soul,” says Glenda.  Over 36 years of abuse and torment Glenda left Adam 10 times. She went back each time until the last, when something snapped. Glenda finally managed to gather her strength, pack her bags and catch the next flight home (they were living together in the UK at that time). With the help of a therapist, her daughter, her family and a now-growing group of friends she has taken steps to take back her self-worth. This time she has said goodbye to Adam forever.   Staying safe Glenda was fortunate that she was able to leave Adam in another country. For many women in abusive relationships their fear of leaving is compounded by a very real physical threat. For this reason, women escaping an abusive relationship should take steps to prevent their partners from seeking them out.  A Protection Order can be obtained from a Magistrate’s Court to prevent an abuser from contacting his victim. There are also provisions in the Domestic Violence Act that cover electronic communication so that he can be barred from contacting her in this way as well. Any woman struggling to leave or with the legal processes of obtaining a Protection Order can contact People Opposing Women Abuse for advice and support.  Rebuilding your life Glenda says that seeing a psychologist was crucial to her recovery. It gave her perspective on what had happened to her and has helped her take the necessary steps to rebuild her life. She now uses a variety of techniques to reclaim her self-worth and to help her to move on. These include:Accepting that the abusive partner is gone forever. Glenda held a “mock funeral” in which she threw away all the gifts that Adam had given her to achieve closureFocusing on yourself – and your children if you have them. Every night before she goes to sleep, Glenda visualises the person that she wants to be and the steps she needs to take towards being that personStarting to date again – when you’re ready. Glenda says that before starting to date again she took time to rebuild her sense of self-worth and her self-esteem. She warns that if you haven’t dealt with your self-esteem issues, you can easily fall into the same abusive cycle with another manMoving on Glenda is now in a relationship with a good, kind man, and she can see a future together with him. She lives for her daughter and her granddaughter, but most importantly for herself. “In fact, the road we’ve all taken seems to have been a blessing in some ways, as horrifying as it is to think that people have to go through such a traumatic and difficult time to reach a good place,” she says.

        "content": "You’ve been dating a guy for a while and you think this relationship has potential. He’s good looking, charming and intelligent. Sure, he’s a bit possessive and he has a temper, but nobody’s perfect, right? Then, one night, after he’s had a couple of drinks, an argument takes a nasty turn. He gets a scary look in his eyes, and just like that, he slaps you so hard you see stars.These kinds of scenarios play out in thousands of households around South Africa every year. The latest crime statistics from the South African government say that between 2012 and 2013, an average of 511 serious assaults were reported to the police every day – and a large number of cases of domestic violence go unreported.Avoid getting trapped in an abusive relationship by taking action the first time your partner assaults you. Remember, your safety is in your hands.Women who have been hit should be aware of the following:  Accept that he will hit you again unless you take action “If he hits you once, chances are he will do it again,” says Jeanette Sera, a social worker at People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA). “Physical abuse can be fatal,” says Jeanette. “It can start with a slap, but it can also cause extensive injuries or even death.”She says that women find it difficult to leave their abusive partners because they still love them and they hope it will never happen again. “But something needs to happen, whether it is counselling or even opening a case of assault. It is important for him to know that what he did is wrong.”He can only change if he gets proper help Many abusers are extremely apologetic the morning after. But a simple apology is not enough. Abusers don’t hit women by accident - the tendency to do so is a part of their make-up. “Unless he is willing to go for therapy to deal with his attitude towards women and relationships, be willing to genuinely look at himself and challenge himself, there is no chance for change,” says Jeanette. She adds, “Therapy is not a once-off activity.”You need emotional support It’s important to accept that what has happened to you is not a dirty secret, but something for which you need the support of friends and family. Talk about it with the people who are closest to you, and they will help you take the next steps. It’s also vital to get the help of a therapist or counsellor.“You need to get emotional support in the form of counselling to make sense of what has happened,” says Jeanette. “In addition to being physically hurt, you will be dealing with disillusionment, betrayal and the loss of trust.”  You can make sure that you are safe It’s obviously important that you act with caution, because your partner has already proven that he has a violent temper. If you believe that you are in danger in any way, you need protect yourself by involving the authorities.“You can seek out a free place of safety for abused women, you can apply for a protection order at a magistrate’s office and you can open a case of assault with the police,” says Jeanette. If you have been the victim of domestic violence and you’re uncertain of the next steps, in need of help or feeling alone, you can contact POWA  for support and advice.You might also like...The invisible scars of emotional abuseFind out how to identify the signs of emotional abuse and how to break free of emotionally abusive relationships Why woman stay in abusive relationshipsBattered women often struggle to leave their abusive partners.

        "content": "You’ve read the décor magazines, you’ve browsed the best homeware shops and you’ve checked out the DIY aisles at your local hardware store. You’re just about ready to embark on a massive home renovation. However, these kinds of projects can often go awry.The keys to a successful home improvement project are careful planning and the right people. With that winning combination, you’ll be on your way to renovation success. Here are the steps you should take before you start your project.1. Draw up a careful plan of what needs to be doneThink carefully about what you want. Cut out pictures from magazines, take photographs of spaces that you love and sketch out your ideas for your home. Try to have a very clear image in your head of your idea so that you can explain it to other people.2. Get quotes and draw up a budgetGet quotes from multiple contractors to give you a sense of the costs involved as well as level of professionalism and range of services covered by each contractor. Itemised quotes will allow you to compare apples with apples, while bearing in mind that the cheapest quote is not necessarily the best one. Remember to ask about whether there will be additional quotes from electricians or plumbers if your work is going to be structural.You can use these quotes to draw up a budget and apply for finance from your bank if necessary.  Remember, however well you plan and budget, building projects generally take longer and cost more. Make sure that you have allowed some contingency in your budget so that you can complete your project when those nasty hidden costs emerge.3. Ask to see prior work and speak to referencesAny decent architect, builder or decorator should have a portfolio of completed work to show to prospective clients. Assess the kinds of jobs that they have done before to make sure that they are competent enough for your job. You can even ask to do a site visit to get a sense of the finer details of their work.Even if a contractor was referred to you by a friend, it is still worth speaking to one or two other prior clients to get their impression of him or her. Their feedback and advice can be helpful not only in helping you to make your mind up about whether to go ahead, but also in managing the building or decorating process.4. Find out if they are registered with any professional organisationsBecause most builders and interior designers are independent contractors, you don’t have someone higher up to complain to if things go wrong. However, if they belong to a professional association, these organisations will often get involved in mediating disputes, and will eject members who have behaved unprofessionally. Of course, you hope that nothing will go wrong, but it’s nice to know that you have recourse if it does. In South Africa, interior designers can join the South African Institute of the Interior Design Profession, builders can be a part of Master Builders South Africa and architects have to register with the South African Council for the Architectural Profession – although there may be regional or voluntary-membership bodies as well.5. Be sure that your project is legally compliantYou don’t need planning permission for any interior changes, but some municipalities have restrictions on exterior changes or renovations on houses that are over a certain age. Be sure that you have researched the building restrictions in your area or complex so that you don’t step on any toes – or worse, get fined – while your project is underway. If you are using an architect, they will generally do this for you.6. Make sure you are coveredSpeak to your home insurance and buildings insurance provider to make sure that you are still covered while a building project is on the go, and to find out whether there are any limitations or restrictions to what you can do. Remember that if your home improvement adds value to your property, you will also need to inform your insurer of this so that you are covered for the full value of your property.Make sure that your contractor also has professional liability insurance in place so that if anything goes wrong, he’s covered.Get rebuilding, redesigning and redecoratingThey say a change is as good as a holiday. Well, soon, you’ll be vacationing in your newly renovated home. It might take you a while to get to your final destination, but with the right planning and the right people on board to get you there, the process will be a whole lot easier and more fun."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Women – young ones in particular – are paying much more for car insurance than they were a year ago in Europe where there has been a ban on insurance companies using gender as risk rating factor. Rather than equalising the playing field between men and women, Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance says the Gender Directive, which prohibits insurance companies using gender as a risk rating factor and stops them from offering cheaper insurance to women based on their gender, is discriminatory against women. “Women are losing out now because they are effectively subsidising the premiums of young male drivers,” she says. Over the last 12 months, and since the Gender Directive was passed into European Union legislature, figures from independent car insurance comparison site www.tiger.co.uk show that insurance premiums for 20 year old female drivers have increased by over 25%. Young male drivers are however enjoying significantly lower premiums. Car insurance premiums for 20 year old men are around 14% less than a year ago, while 25 year old men are benefitting from rates almost 25% less. In the UK, younger women historically enjoyed lower premiums than their male counterparts as they were perceived by insurers as being lower insurance risks. But, the difference in pricing between genders typically narrowed as men aged and were considered less risky drivers. This pricing “bias” was based on decades of empirical actuarial analysis and reflected the fact that young female drivers tend to have lower impact accidents than young male drivers. Banned from using gender as a core rating factor, insurers have had to re-price their policies which resulted in a marked upswing in policy prices for younger women. In South Africa, there is no such law as the Gender Directive on the immediate horizon and Farrell says that for as long as women are statistically-shown to be safer drivers than men, they should have access to cheaper car insurance. Short-term insurance premiums are calculated based on the risk profile of the policyholder and this is affected by a number of things. The entire insurance industry differentiates in terms of age, gender, geography, years of insurance, type of car, and licence period, for example. “Our products are geared for women who are statistically-proven to be safer drivers than men. They take fewer risks, make more careful decisions, and generally claim less often than men. When they do, the claims value is considerably lower. Our premiums reflect the fact that women are less of a risk to insure. This is not going to change.” Farrell concludes saying that 1st for Women offers lower premiums to women because statistical evidence shows that they have a lower risk profile. “Women should benefit from lower premiums because they deserve it. A law similar to the Gender Directive in South Africa would drive up women’s insurance premiums as it has in the UK. That wouldn’t be fair.”"

        "content": "According to a survey conducted by a UK-based hair salon chain, the average woman changes her hairstyle about 150 times in her lifetime. These changes are usually connected to a major life event but the biggest reason women change their look is simply “because she was tired of it – she wanted a change”. These survey findings resonate with the women-only insurance company, 1st for Women Insurance, who recently gave its Guardian Angel fleet a fresh and fun makeover. “We launched our Guardian Angel breakdown assistance service in 2009 in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban and it was time for a change. We found that although our pink BMW’s were very eye-catching, not many people understood their purpose. Our new branding not only provides some eye-candy for the ladies, but also explains how the Guardian Angels can help damsels in distress,” says Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance. The Guardian Angels were launched to assist and ‘guard’ woman motorists if they have a mechanical breakdown, a flat battery or flat tyre in a dangerous place. These features are now clearly visible on the new fleet of 1 and 3 series BMW’s. “The Guardian Angel service is available for all female motorists, not just 1st for Women customers. By calling our roadside assistance number a Guardian Angel will be dispatched when a female motorist feels unsafe to either assist with the problem or to “guard” the motorist until help arrives,” says Farrell. “Graffiti is proud to have played a small role in helping to create 1st for Women\"s powerful pink presence on our roads. The distinctive pink vehicles have become synonymous with the 1st for Women brand over the years, generating a feel-good perception of a company that’s going the extra mile,\" says John Rice, managing director of Graffiti."

        "content": "A recent study has found that men are more likely than women to drive drunk. In the survey, 27% of men admitted to driving over the limit compared to 10% of women. According to Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance, “We’ve always said that women are less risky on the road than their male counterparts but the reality is that no one should drive under the influence of alcohol. In South Africa, alcohol plays a role in over 60% of road deaths*.” According to the Department of Transport, a total of 69 411 people were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs from April 2011 to March 2012. This is an increase of more than 100% compared to 2004 / 2005. “This increase in the number of arrests points to increased focus on policing the crime. High police visibility and an increase in road blocks, especially over weekends, is testimony to this and is a stark reminder that road officials are cracking-down on reckless drivers who get behind the wheel after boozing,” says Farrell.Farrell reminds South Africans that the implications of being caught aren’t pretty. “If you’re found guilty of drunk driving you could face up to six years in jail and you could be liable for fines of up to R120 000. Your driver’s licence could also be suspended. This means that you will have a criminal record which will impact your life forever. Of course, the worst case scenario of driving under the influence is that you kill somebody or yourself.” She reminds motorists that the legal blood alcohol limit is less than 0.05 g per 100 ml and the legal breath alcohol limit is less than 0.24 mg in 1000 ml of breath. “At a blood alcohol concentration of between 0.03 to 0.05 per 100ml, people suffer from impaired concentration, and decreased inhibition and judgement. At a level of 0.06, depth perception is affected, alertness is decreased and reactions are dramatically slower. The crux of it is that you actually shouldn’t drive if you have had even one drink,” she warns.You do have options but driving under the influence is not one of them. Alcohol is a factor in the majority of accidents in South Africa, so driving after drinking is a no-go, concludes Farrell. * South Africans Against Drunk Driving"

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance’s charitable trust, the 1st for Women Foundation, together with 1st for Women customers are making a tangible and sustainable difference to the lives of thousands of South African women affected by gender-based violence and cervical cancer. Since 2005, the Foundation has donated over R30 million to a number of women-related charity organisations that focus on assisting survivors of gender-based violence and making the HPV vaccine more accessible to South African women.For the first time, 1st for Women Insurance has decided to highlight the Foundation with a TV advert which was launched on 5 June 2014. “The new advert pays homage to the thousands of South African women who, every day, work so tirelessly to care for everyone around them – it salutes their selflessness, applauds their generosity and speaks to the collective power of women - ultimately acknowledging a woman’s inherent ability to give, regardless of her situation or circumstance,” says Robyn Farrell, Executive Head of 1st for Women Insurance. The advert was conceptualised by Black River FC, produced by Jump and Janet Sender and directed by Michael Middleton. According to Ahmed Tilly, Creative Director at Black River FC: “We think viewers will connect with this story in a way that not only inspires and uplifts them, but also gets them thinking differently about women. Although the situation portrayed in the advert is a sad reality in South Africa, we were able to illustrate it in a positive light – focusing on the strength and dignity of women.” “Our customers donate a portion of their monthly insurance premium to the 1st for Women Foundation and thanks to them, we have managed to help over 150 000 survivors of gender-based violence through public advocacy training, community dialogues and workshops. We have also provided 2 500 pap smears to women in extremely rural areas and provided early treatment for over 100 of these women. This is something we are very proud of! Here’s to our customers – to their selflessness and generosity,” concludes Farrell. To view the TV commercial – click here"

That’s because, for the first time, we have decided to highlight the 1st for Women Foundation and not the fact that women are a better insurance risk than their male counterparts,” explains Robyn Farrell, Executive Head of 1st for Women. The 1st for Women Foundation was launched in 2005. It’s funded by 1st for Women’s customers who donate a portion of their monthly insurance premium to the Foundation. Since its inception, the Foundation has donated over R30 million to a number of women-related charity organisations that focus on two main causes: gender-based violence and cervical cancer. The new campaign was conceptualised by Black River FC, produced by Jump and Janet Sender and directed by Michael Middleton. “It pays homage to the thousands of South African women who, every day, work so tirelessly to care for everyone around them – it salutes their selflessness, applauds their generosity and speaks to the collective power of women - ultimately acknowledging a woman’s inherent ability to give, regardless of her situation or circumstance,” says Farrell.

        "content": "Getting the most out of life is often a matter of carefully balancing work and home commitments in a sustainable manner, so as not to lose yourself, your loved ones, or your foothold on success. We wanted to find out for ourselves if there\"s a key to making it work. So we decided to sit down with Amy Kleinhans-Curd to discuss her work-life strategy one that she\"s carefully refined through her many years of experience as a mom, wife and prospering entrepreneur.Is there a secret formula to your success?Amy: Customise your strategy. In my experience, it\"s a journey that every woman has to go on so she can establish what works, and what doesn\"t.How do you manage your workspace?Amy: Both your work and your home spaces require your full attention, so I endeavour to keep them separate, as far as possible. Whether that means working at my study, or the coffee shop up the road, when I need to be close to home it\"s important to set clear boundaries between these two spaces.What do you do when you feel like your hands are just getting too full?Amy: Get back-up. Don\"t do things you don\"t have to. Find a babysitter and send your husband on a cooking course. Communicate with your support structure so they know how to be there for you. Don\"t be afraid to delegate you\"re not alone!How do you keep your business structure in place?Amy: Have a plan. A concise business plan will ensure that you cover all aspects of your business process. Keeping a schedule for your home activities is equally important. Knowing that you have a plan in place allows you to focus more on enjoying your time at home.How do you cope with surprises?Amy: I try and be as flexible as possible; to take control of the things I can, and to plan for the things I have no control over. The more adaptable you can be, the more you will thrive outside your comfort zone.How do you maintain a positive attitude when things get hectic?Amy: Sometimes it\"s okay to leave the dishes in the sink. Forgive yourself for snapping at your husband and forgetting the soy patty for that one vegetarian dinner guest. Guilt has a way of taking the joy out of the things that make you happy. Learn from mistakes and let go of guilt.How do you manage time with your partner?Amy: Aim for quality time. Don\"t forget Date Night. The time you have with your husband is so precious, even if it\"s just a cup of coffee or watching TV on the couch together. Also, make sure that you have quality time with your kids take them for a walk or just watch TV with them. Memories that you and your kids can treasure will be such an anchor in the future.How do stay grounded in those chaotic times?Amy: I make it a priority to make time for myself. If you take care of your mind, you take care of your world, says Huffington Post founder Arianne Huffington. Get enough sleep.Don\"t neglect the simple things that bring you joy.At the end of the day, it is possible to find that sweet spot where things are going great both at work and in your personal life. Amy is living proof of this but it\"s important to remember that balance is key.If your business is insured with 1st for Women, we\"re here to lend a hand. 1st for Women Business services, included with your policy at no extra cost, are there to assist you with everything from legal advice to sourcing great deals on whatever it is your business needs.

We had a chat to two women who\"ve made their home their office and asked them for some advice on staying productive, meeting deadlines, and avoiding the snooze button.It\"s important to be disciplined about your work hours and manage your time effectively. When planning how you\"ll spend your time, build in buffers for the things that can trip you up in terms of delivery, to be safe. It\"s also worth playing to your strengths, so consider outsourcing time-intensive work you may be less good at to leave you free to focus on your core business. Lastly, when things are quiet, remember that you can still use the time to strategize and look for opportunities.Merridy Edgson, Accredited Leadership Coach and FacilitatorDiscipline is crucial I\"ve learned the hard way that 8 hours can fly past. It\"s easy to get caught up with the day-to-day tasks of being on the phone, answering emails and checking various social media accounts for work, but I\"ve still got to make sure that I get clients\" assignments done on time. When you work for yourself, no work means no pay so losing focus can really impact on your business. I make sure my deadlines are met by creating weekly and daily plans. Over weekends I prepare a schedule of tasks for each of my clients for the following week and allocate days for the work. Then, each night I check my dairy for the next day\"s work, and prioritise the tasks.\"Shirley Williams, Durban-based Marketing Consultant and PublicistIf you\"re planning on working from home, remember these tips:Block off your work hoursTake the time to plan your weeks and days ahead it\"ll save you time in the long runBuild in a little buffer time for key deadlinesOutsource non-core work if necessaryTime really is money; keep your eye on what boosts the bottom line to maintain focus, and prioritise your tasks accordinglyUse quiet times to strategize and look for new opportunitiesBusiness insured with 1st for Women?

        "content": "Keeping your mind and body healthy is essential but keeping your business financially fit is equally important. How do you do it? That\"s the question. Firstly, you\"ve got to put your business\"s credit health first.Ask yourself, Is my business able to meet its monthly obligations? Can I repay my existing loans without breaking my monthly budget? Can I do it every month? Or do I cross my fingers and hope for a windfall on the 20th? Is my business able to take on more credit without causing any additional stress?The thing is, maintaining your business\"s credit health isn\"t always easy, especially in today\"s tough economy. Everything seems to be getting more expensive and creditors are slow to pay. And that\"s why it\"s so easy to find your business slipping further and further into debt.As an entrepreneur, you have two choices: let the debt overwhelm you or take action now. To make things a little easier for you, we\"ve got a list of debt do\"s and don\"ts.DON\"TDon\"t ignore letters of demand from creditors.Don\"t only pay the outstanding amount on the most pressing accounts with the intention of paying only a little to another creditor next month.Don\"t borrow more money to pay existing debt.Don\"t max out one credit card to pay another.Don\"t fool yourself into thinking the situation will straighten itself out on its own.DOGet an objective appreciation of the true state of your business\"s debt situation. Start by obtaining your business\"s credit report you can buy your TransUnion Business Credit Report by logging on to www.mytransunion.co.za or calling 0861 482 482.List all the active loans, credit and other account information from your credit report.Write down your anticipated total monthly income (not the amount of income you hope to achieve).List all your monthly expenses. Don\"t leave anything out and do not underestimate.Calculate your monthly budget.Try to reduce your monthly overheads so that you are able to save 10% of your income each month. For example:Examine your budget honestly and critically so see where you can realistically reduce your expenses. Decide what are must-haves and nice-to-haves. Reduce expenditure on nice-to-haves.Look for ways to reduce your must-have monthly expenses. Plan the route and schedule of deliveries to save on petrol; conserve water; switch off computers, air conditioners, and the urn at night; try to avoid unnecessary trips on tolled highways.Use these savings to pay off your debts, and consider paying off the following first:any debts with high interest ratesaccounts above 35% of their credit limitdebts that are close to be being paid offthose with high annual feesCreate a payment calendar with the due dates of each debt and the payment amounts and stick to it.GET AN EXPERT\"S OPINIONWhether you need advice with your business\"s credit rating, want to apply for funding to expand your operations, or whether you just need some guidance in terms of your VAT income tax returns, 1st for Women also offers sound financial advice, included in policies at no extra cost, to all of our Business Insurance customers.

        "content": "The sudden onslaught of homework, studying and projects when our children start primary school is a large source of pain for most parents. We are responsible for helping them to do well academically, but with today\"s hurried lifestyle, fitting another task into our already-stretched-thin evenings can feel overwhelming.Unfortunately, there\"s no way around it. Homework is almost as inevitable as death and taxes. The best thing you can do for you and your child is establish good study habits early habits that foster motivation and independence so that homework isn\"t a constant battle or a source of unhappiness for both of you.Support from home is essential in helping children of all abilities to learn, says Kath Kenyon, a private remedial teacher and the owner of Learning Kat Remedial Teaching. Establishing good study habits and a holistic approach to learning from early on will go a long way towards making your child\"s school career a fulfilling and successful one.She suggests these seven steps to help your child develop healthy home-learning habits, from their first day of school, (but it\"s never too late to implement them):1. Set a routine from the outsetRoutine takes the pressure off everyone. The first time that your child gets homework, establish how it\"s going to be done. If you are at home with them in the afternoons, get them to do their homework right after a snack and a short rest, while they are still in learning mode. If you aren\"t at home, request that their caregiver gets started with them, and then check their work when you get home. If this is still not possible, do it as your first evening activity together, rather than your last.It helps to have it out of the way earlier on so that the rest of the day can be enjoyed without anything hanging over both of you. Whatever you do, don\"t let your children learn to do things in a last-minute panic when the pressure is on and the work won\"t be up to standard.2. Create a study spaceDon\"t let your child do their homework on the floor of their room or in front of the TV. Set up a study space either at a desk or at a kitchen or dining room table with no distractions. Make sure that they are comfortable, can see clearly and are able to sit without slouching over their work.Their brains will soon accept that this is where learning takes place and be ready to focus when they sit down in their space.3. Don\"t be a helicopterWhile it is very important to be supportive of your children\"s studying, you have to let them struggle a bit to find their own way. Hovering over them has two drawbacks it prevents them from learning for themselves, and it can actually add pressure because they are burdened with your focus and expectations. Be available and try to help them constructively rather than telling them how and giving the answers.4. Use rewards to motivate themGive them something to look forward to once they\"ve completed their work for the evening. This is not to suggest that they get a sweet or a gift for every column of addition that they get right, but rather to give them something enjoyable to look forward to once they\"re done.For instance, they can earn their television time by completing their homework well and on time. We like to encourage parents to reward their children with time spent with rather than money spent on their children.5. Display an interest in their learning and make it funDon\"t make a chore out of homework. Ask your children about what they are doing, tell them interesting facts about things that they are learning and be impressed with the knowledge that they\"ve gained. Talk about your own experiences of learning the same information, and research interesting topics further with them.Incorporate learning into everyday activities baking, for instance, is a great way to bed down mathematical concepts. The key thing here is to merge their school and home lives and their interests with their studies.6. Help them to understand planningIf they have a longer-term project, help them to break it down into smaller chunks with scheduled milestones along the way. A wall calendar is a great way to mark off time and you can add in after-school activities and other appointments to teach them how to integrate life and work.7. Limit their screen time and get them outdoorsLittle minds are far more receptive to learning if little bodies aren\"t restless and desperate for movement. Our children are probably already bound by a curriculum that expects too much focus from them, so make sure that they spend time in outdoor play to counter that. They should play at least one organised sport every week, and get outdoors to climb trees or walk the dog every afternoon.And they shouldn\"t have more than one hour of screen time (any screen!) a day.Invest in their futuresWe put a great deal of effort into finding the best schools for our children and providing them with access to the right learning materials and activities. But often the thing that is hardest to get right is our own part in this process. Do your best to be respectful of school work, interested in what your children are learning, and supportive of their journey by establishing learning habits that will help them to flourish without your involvement.This is the best investment in their future that you can make.

        "description": "",
        "content": "In the winter months it can be tempting to curl up with hot chocolate and pizza and forget about the world outside. However, the cold weather is no excuse to abandon healthy eating habits. Why not get back into the swing of things with some inspiration from superfoods?Although the term superfood is used quite freely, it essentially means foods that are nutrient-dense and deliver more health benefits per mouthful than other foods. Make sure that you\"re getting the vitamins and minerals you need to keep you healthy and fight off colds and flu with six of the top winter superfoods.1. KaleKale is known as superfood number 1 for its mega-dose of vitamin K and antioxidants such as vitamin C and beta-carotene. The free radical neutralising effects of this leafy vegetable also prevent the loss of skin elasticity, so kale will keep you looking younger too. Of course, while kale is king, any leafy vegetable is a healthy addition to your diet.Use it in: stir-fries, salads or soups, or simply sautÃ© a packetful with garlic, soy sauce and sesame oil and enjoy it as a meal on its own.2. GarlicGarlic is packed with allicin, one of the most potent antioxidants found in foods. It also contains vitamin C, zinc and selenium. Together, all these vitamins and minerals make garlic a powerful antifungal, antibacterial and antibiotic agent that reduces your risk of cancer, heart disease, asthma and some skin conditions.Use it in: Garlic is a delicious addition to just about any savoury meal, adding flavour to soups, stews, pasta sauces and pestos. Next time you make a Sunday roast, throw a whole head of garlic into the tray, and then squeeze out the mellow garlic paste from each clove when the roast is done. Don\"t forget the parsley!3. Sweet potatoSweet potatoes contain high levels of vitamin A and are unsurpassed as sources of beta-carotene. They are also a low-GI food, meaning that although they offer that lovely sweet flavour, they aren\"t making your blood sugar levels spike.Use them in: Although nothing beats a slow-roasted, caramelised sweet potato, the best way to preserve their nutritional benefits is to steam them. You can then eat them as they are, with a glug of olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, or you can turn them into a delicious mash as a side dish.4. BeetrootsBeetroots are full of amino acids, vitamins and minerals, as well as betacyanin, which gives them their deep red colour and helps fight colon cancer. They help keep your blood pressure low and combat anaemia.Use them in: Beetroots are beautiful roasted or boiled and then sliced into a salad along with feta and pumpkin seeds, but for the purest punch, juice them with carrots and apples to make a bright red power smoothie to start your day.5. SalmonSalmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help decrease the risk of heart disease and promote brain health. This oily fish is also a great source of protein, vitamin A and vitamin B. Of course, wild organic salmon is the best way to enjoy salmon, but tinned, smoked or farmed still offer these health benefits.Use it in: Marinade salmon in a mixture of honey and soy sauce, and then enjoy with basmati and wild rice and a side of leafy greens.6. PomegranatesChuck out your other beverages and start drinking pomegranate juice it has been found to have two to three times the antioxidant power of green tea or red wine. Pomegranates improve cardiovascular health, provide anti-inflammatory phytochemicals and lower blood pressure.Use them in: Add pomegranates to salads or fruit salads, or enjoy them on their own as addictive little snacks. You can also buy pomegranate juice to get the benefits without having to fiddle with the little juicy gems.Eat a variety of healthy foodsThe appeal of so-called superfoods is that they provide a greater portion of nutrients per serving than regular foods. However, simply adding a superfood a day to your diet doesn\"t make up for other bad eating habits. The best advice for healthy eating is to eat a variety of fruit and vegetables, make sure you get your protein from organic or non-animal sources and avoid deep fried and overly processed foods as well as too much sugar, caffeine or alcohol.

        "description": "",
        "content": "A long daily commute is often mind-numbingly unproductive and a waste of time. If your daily road trip were meditative or relaxing, you could at least say you were getting something out of it, but instead you are probably stressed and angry as you push your way through traffic. Don\"t despair. With a little creativity you can use your time in the car to do your mind (and even your body) some good.Here are five things that you can do with half an hour twice a day from the comfort of your own (or someone else\"s) car.1. Listen to podcastsEveryone\"s talking about podcasts. These downloadable audio files range from documentaries to fiction, and give you a fascinating look into whatever topic catches your fancy. The podcast that got everyone talking about podcasts in 2014 was Serial, in which a host unravels a real-life murder mystery. But that\"s only the very beginning of this new media journey. Check out these leading podcasts to get you started, or these created especially for women.To play a podcast, you can stream it live from its creator\"s website, or you can download it onto your smartphone (which is what you\"ll want to do for your commute), using the Podcasts app for iPhones, the Stitcher app for Android, The Podcasts! app for Windows or bPod for BlackBerry.2. Listen to audiobooksIf you find that you never have enough time to read books, consider using your daily commute as your literary escape. Audible now provides a vast range of books for download to compatible Kindle devices (including smart phones), so you can devour pretty much any book you\"d like to get your teeth into in audio format.Now you can read anything from the classics to new releases and nonfiction  without so much as opening a book.3. Learn a languageThe best way to learn a language is to hear it spoken. And what better place to listen to the spoken word than in your car? You can use the Michael Thomas Method, a renowned audio language learning process, in which you repeat back the phrases of a language as you hear them, or the Pimsleur Approach, which provides learning in chunks so as not to overwhelm the student.You can buy these and many other language audio files and CDs on the internet.4. Expand your music educationYou can expand your own music education by making playlists or burning CDs of music you would like to explore. If you\"ve always wanted to know more about the classics from the Beetles to Beethoven then do a little research and download the music you wish you knew more about.5. Do your kegel exercisesAfter you\"ve given your ears a workout, it\"s time to focus onâ€¦ another part of you. Every woman should do her kegel exercises daily to strengthen her pelvic floor to prepare her for childbirth and prevent her from becoming incontinent later in life. What better place to do them than in the car when you have nothing else to do? (No one can tell.)To get a pelvic floor workout, first find your kegel muscles they are the ones that you tighten when you don\"t want to urinate. Clench them (your stomach muscles shouldn\"t tighten). Hold for three seconds then relax for three seconds. Repeat 12 to 15 times. Try to do this two times a day (on your way to work and on your way home is the perfect interval). And add a second each week as your muscles get stronger.6. Flatten your stomachDon\"t stop with your kegels. There are loads of exercises that you can do while stationery in the sitting position. You can try these to flatten your stomach, or these to help stretch your spine. You\"re probably not going to manage a full-body workout without getting on your feet, but if you can strengthen your core and relieve the tension in your back and neck, then that alone has made your car trip worthwhile.Time is a gift use itIt is very easy to become complacent about time spent doing nothing. As these activities show, if you want to use your time behind the wheel or in the passenger seat productively, there are loads of ways to do it. Just change your thinking so that you see your commute as time to be used, not time to be wasted."

        "content": "Women\"s position in society has changed remarkably over the last five decades. The era of modernization and the rise of women economic empowerment gave women the opportunity to leave the domestic space and enter the corporate world.  Today, more and more women occupy jobs traditionally associated with men, with some even becoming sole breadwinners in their household.The labour force, however, still shows inequalities today.  Statistics by the United States Department of Labour indicate the rate for women\"s participation in the labour force is expected to reach 57.2 percent by 2020 as opposed to the 96.7 percent for men.  A recent report by Catalyst.org also reveals that women earned 82.5% of men\"s salaries in 2014. This confirms that the gender pay gap is real and that women still face discrimination in terms of age, ethnicity, education and economic background.As such, many women choose to start their own business, but even this initiative is not without its challenges.  To get a business underway can be tricky for women as they often lack the financial resources and networking opportunities.   Despite these obstacles, a few women have shown that it is not impossible to make it all by oneself in the business world. Because 1st for Women is all about putting ladies first when it comes to business insurance, we bring you inspiring stories of five self-made female entrepreneurs who have made it to the top and the secrets to their astonishing success.Elizabeth Holmes CEO of Theranos\"I wanted to create a whole new technology, and one that is aimed at helping humanity at all levels, regardless of geography or ethnicity or age or gender.\"When Elizabeth Holmes started selling Ccompilers to universities in China at a very young age, she already showed entrepreneurial promise.  However, it was only when she enrolled at Stanford University to study chemical engineering that things began to fall in place for her.  After coming up with an idea for blood testing technology, Elizabeth decided to drop out of college to pursue her dreams of starting a blood diagnostics company. She initially ran the company from the basement of a sorority house, but went big later on, naming her business Theranos. The company is now worth $9bn with Elizabeth owning a 50 percent share. She is currently the world\"s youngest self-made female billionaire.Amanda Hockings best-selling author\"I\"ve spent twenty-six years writing, and eight years studying what it takes to make writing my career. I write commercial fiction, with nice covers and good prices. And I happened to publish during an e-book revolution. So if you want to know the secret to my success”it\"s all right there.Amanda Hockings revolutionized the book publishing industry when she self-published her novels on Amazon.com.  Like her British counterpart, JK Rowling, Amanda was completely broke when she started out writing fiction and was also rejected by several traditional book publishers.   She was determined to get her books published or, at least, to make enough money to attend a Muppets show in Chicago.  Amanda risked the road less travelled and uploaded her books on Amazon. Within a year the books earned her $2.5m and an option to turn her Trylle trilogy into a major Hollywood film.  Alakija Folorunsho founder and executive vice-chairman of Famfa Oil Limited\"It has not been a rag to riches fairytale. It has not been an overnight phenomenon like some cases which you find here and there all over the world. For as long as I can remember, I had always wanted my own business. Hard workâ€¦ I am trying to tell you how I got to where I am if you want those billions. Hard work, diligence, persistenceâ€¦ days where you nearly gave up but I chose not to give up.\"It may not be a typical rags-to-riches story, but Alakija Folorunsho\"s journey from secretary to oil tycoon is an inspiring one nonetheless.  Although she had a relatively wealthy family, Alakija chose to venture independently from her family\"s money.  She started out in the business world with her own fashion label, Supreme Stitches, which did extremely well.    This didn\"t stop Alakijah from achieving greater things. Her connection with Maryam Babangida, wife to Nigeria\"s former military president, gave her an opportunity to endeavour in the oil industry with no experience at all. She was awarded an oil-prospecting license and began searching for oil with her new company Famfa Limited.  Her company is now one of Nigeria\"s biggest oil block production companies.  Alakija is Nigeria\"s first female billionaire and Africa\"s richest woman with a fortune of $2.5bn.Sarah Blakely founder of Spanx\"Believe in your idea, trust your instincts, and don\"t be afraid to fail. If you believe in your idea 100% don\"t let anyone stop you\"When Sarah Blakely cut off her pantyhose at a private party, little did she know it would make her a billionaire in just 15 years. Sarah was a salesperson selling fax machines door to door when she came up with an idea that would revolutionize the hosiery industry. With only $5000 in personal savings at her disposal, Sarah started her Spanx brand which ultimately went on to become a multi-million dollar company. In 2014, Forbes named her as the 93rd most powerful woman in the world. Denise Coates founder and chief executive of Bet365\"I probably had a few [meetings] at first where I had to put somebody right but I knew my business, so it wasn\"t a problem â€¦ I just wanted to get on with making my business successful. I\"ve never dwelled on the fact, or thought about the fact, that I was a woman.\"Denise Coates worked as a cashier in her family bookmarking business Provincial Racing before she went to the University of Sheffield to be trained as an accountant. After she completed her studies she returned to her father\"s betting shops and became managing director of the estate.  In 2000, Denise started an online betting site which has grown to become one of the world\"s largest online gambling companies.  Denise has a 50.01 percent share in the company and a personal fortune of about $2.5 billion, making her the 723rd richest person in the world according to Forbes.We\"ve shared some interesting tales of fortune with youâ€¦ all about women that made it to the top, in their very own ways. Though the route they all took was slightly different, simple principles like hard work and perseverance lies at the premise of it all.Louis Pasteur once said, that chance favours only the prepared mind. These women all prepared themselves methodically for the success that they sought, through hard work and perseverance. And so the question remains - if they could do it what\"s stopping you?"

        "content": "In a 2012 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Women\"s Report, it was revealed that sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of women wanting to start a business, with 51% intending to become entrepreneurs in the next three years. Of course, intention doesn\"t always lead to the realisation of a dream, and many women entrepreneurs face numerous challenges as they take the first steps to starting a business of their own.Becoming an entrepreneur takes guts, determination and support. While the guts and determination is up to you, we can help you out a little with the support. Here are some resources for South African women entrepreneurs to help you grow your skills, confidence and business.Apply for a government grant to kick-start your businessIn 2013, government ramped up its support for small businesses and launched a number of measures to help entrepreneurs launch or grow their business. These grants and the qualification criteria are listed on the DTI\"s website. Apply to the IDC or SEDA for business fundingThe Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) is a national development finance institution that aims to promote economic growth. They have set aside specific funds to finance businesses through the Women Entrepreneurial Fund (WEF). They also supply business plan support, training and mentorship to qualifying applicants.The Small Enterprise Development Agency (Seda) is an agency of the Department of Small Business Development. It has published a booklet outlining all the funding opportunities available for women starting up their own small businesses.Find a mentor to guide you on your entrepreneurial journeyWomen often find that the support and advice of other women who have been there and done that is vital to their entrepreneurial success. But successful female mentors aren\"t always readily available - you have to know where to find them. SME Toolkit South Africa has published this list of professional associations that connect entrepreneurs with established businesswomen. Crowdfund your business through Kickstarter or IndiegogoYou\"ve heard of people funding their businesses through online crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo . If you have a big idea that you think will excite and amaze people, get online, build a project and market the heck out of it to your online and offline community.  Join the Businesswomen\"s Association for access to support and funding The Businesswomen\"s Association of South Africa (BWASA) is the largest and most prominent association of business and professional women in the country. For women entrepreneurs, the Business Women\"s Association (BWA) provides access to finance, networking, enterprise development and compliance advice as well as supplier diversity programmes, business health clinics, business incubation, and markets and trade opportunities through local, national and global business linkage programmes.Members also have access to lifestyle benefits that include car rental, chauffeur and transfer discounts and access to the BWASA/SAA Corporate Loyalty Programme.Expand your knowledge with free coursesMany universities around the world have made their course material available through massive open online course (MOOC) platforms like Coursera or EdX. This means that you can access the course material for degrees from Harvard, MIT, Stanford or even Wits (from the end of this year through EdX), and complete the modules online, at your own time. The courses are free, but you don\"t get an official credit at the university (although in some cases you can pay to upgrade), but you can expand your knowledge and understanding of your chosen profession or develop business skills.Local business school Regenesys  has created the same kind of free online course structure, but again, you have to pay to convert to an accredited degree.Get information and inspiration at SME South AfricaSME South Africa is a portal for SME development news in South Africa. Be inspired by stories of success from other entrepreneurs or learn about developments in the start-up space. There\"s a specific section for women that profiles women in business and publishes stories about mentorship, funding and motivation.Get ready; get set; go! With a combination of grit, determination and a big idea, as well as the support of the services that we\"ve outlined, you will be well on your way to business success. Just remember, it\"s lonely at the top, so be sure to find a way to bring other women up there along with you. We wish you well on your path to business leadership.Remember that every small business needs insurance for when things don\"t go according to plan.

        "heading": "8 questions before you take a loan",
        "description": "",
        "content": "These days, every bank, credit provider and micro-lender is offering you money. You receive text messages on your phone, you see ads in the paper or on billboards, and you probably even receive offers in the mail.  All this loan marketing comes with a simple message: taking out a loan gives you the financial freedom to do whatever you want, right away.This sounds like a dream come true, doesn\"t it? But what these loan providers are not telling you is that this financial freedom is extremely short lived. At the end of the month, your repayments will begin, and you\"ll find yourself bound by the money you owe. Where\"s that freedom now?So, before you leap at the chance to take out a personal loan, here are eight questions you should ask yourself before you sign on the dotted line.   1. Should I be saving rather than borrowing?The answer to this question is almost always saving. Unless you are buying a car or a house or taking out a loan to finance a (sensible) business opportunity or some form of study or training, it is better to save now and spend later.2. Am I satisfied that this is an isolated instance of borrowing?Debt is almost never a good idea, but if you do take out a loan, it should be an exception rather than a financial habit. If you absolutely have to borrow money to get by, make sure that you\"ve made a plan to reduce your expenses and increase your savings, rather than relying on credit to get you through the next rough patch3. Do I have enough money to pay this loan back every month?While registered lenders will carry out an affordability test before granting you a loan, it is possible to access credit that you can\"t afford by being vague or misleading in your responses or by approaching an unscrupulous lender who does not carry out an affordability test. A rule of thumb for affordability is if you are struggling to make ends meet, then you are unlikely to be able to afford the extra costs of servicing a loan.4. What are the interest rate and fees on this loan?Remember that you will be charged interest on the amount that you borrow. Your bank will be able to show you how much you will pay back in total, after interest has been added. You should also find out whether the interest rate can increase if the repo rate goes up!  Be sure to ask about activation, admin and insurance fees so that you get a very clear idea of how much the loan will really cost you. You should always shop around to be sure that you are getting the best deal on interest and fees.5. What is the term of the loan?You may be offered different options for the time it will take you to pay back the loan. It can be appealing to take out the longest loan term because the monthly repayments are cheaper. However, while each month\"s payment might be cheaper, you will be paying interest for longer, so the total that you pay back will be higher. Always try to pay a loan back in the shortest possible period.6. Am I borrowing from a scrupulous lender?Loan sharks or micro-lenders sometimes make it easier for you to borrow from them, however in most instances they charge high interest rates and resort to threatening you if you are unable to make repayments. It is never a good idea to accept their offer. If you must borrow, borrow from a registered and reputable credit provider. If they have turned you down, it\"s probably because you can\"t afford the loan and you will only get yourself into trouble if you go through an alternative lender. 7. Is early settlement allowed?If you find that you have extra cash and can pay your loan back quicker (always a good idea), be sure that you can do this without penalty. Some lenders make an interest calculation based on the term of the loan and don\"t actually want you to pay back the money earlier, so they will charge you a penalty to do so.8. If I die, how will my loan be repaid?If you were to pass away, the lender cannot claim money back from your relatives. However, they can claim the money back from your estate which is the sum of all your assets and cash at the time of your death. This means that the money will have to be found from within your estate to service the debt, which could mean that a house or car would need to be sold, leaving your family with a smaller inheritance. For this reason, if you have dependents and have taken out a loan, it\"s a good idea to have credit life cover or life insurance in place.The bottom line Loans should be isolated incidents of borrowing that deliver some kind of return. You should not borrow money to make ends meet or to afford your monthly expenses. But if you have to take out a personal loan for any reason, be sure that you can afford to pay it back, and that you have understood the interest rate and the other terms and conditions of your loan.If you have satisfied all these conditions, then take out the loan and pay it back as quickly as you can.

        "content": "With the modern pressures of work, money, health, relationships and just getting by, you sometimes need to get away from it all. Of course, leaping on a plane and heading to a tropical island would be just the tonic, but unfortunately, this can\"t be put into practice every Friday evening when you\"re in need of a bit of a pick me up.Rather, it\"s important that you have an easily accessible space in which you can unwind. Of course, unwinding is easy on a beach, with a cocktail, and a sunset, and palm trees, but for instant succour, you need something a little closer to home. This happy place in which you can relax, power down or be re-energised needs to be accessible, achievable and instantly calming. Here\"s how to get into your happy place and then get the most out of it.How to find your happy placeThink about the thing that makes you feel rested and revitalised. Is it a soft, comfy pillow, is it being in nature or is it looking at a peaceful garden? You can also identify an action that goes with it, like taking a bath, reading a book or taking a walk. When you have a good sense of the place and activity that soothe your soul, try to think of a way to combine them somewhere that you can reliably get to, and consistently have to yourself.It\"s important to remember that your happy place mustn\"t be something that uses up your energy, so while having a glass of wine with friends or going to the gym are both important and positive aspects of your life, they don\"t deliver on the happy-place promise of providing you with much-needed downtime.Make a date with your happy placeMost people know that they need to make some time to calm down and get away from it all, but somehow, this gets stacked behind all the other, more pressing obligations. It\"s vital that you declare your time-out as a personal responsibility and, if you\"re not getting to it, schedule it in on your diary even if the date is two weeks from now.And don\"t let anyone come up with a better suggestion. This is what you need.Take what you need into your happy placeThere\"s no point in popping in and out of your happy place. Plan your time there. Take in a book, a drink, a jacket or a snack so that you are completely catered to and independent. Obviously, if you realise you need something, you can dash out and get it, but the point is to enjoy uninterrupted down time, so try to prepare yourself for that.Allow no intrusions to your happy placeGet rid of any potential interruptions. Let your friends and family know that you are not available because you\"re having some much-needed me time. Turn off your phone (no, Facebook is not your happy place) and dump the iPad.While happy places are supposed to be easy to get to, if you can\"t get away from your family at home, sometimes you need to find a place where you are physically inaccessible. Rent a hotel room by the hour if need be, or go to your mom\"s house but ask her to go shopping.Don\"t compromise in your happy placeIf your partner thinks that an afternoon in bed with a book sounds like just what he\"d like to be doing too, tell him to get his own happy place (and be willing to let him go). While it is possible to unwind in the presence of someone else, another personality can alter the course of your relaxation, so it\"s best not to make it a party for two.And if you\"re relaxing at home, don\"t agree to watch the roast, let the plumber in or remember to switch off the pool pump. You need to be immersed in the experience, not drowning in the admin you\"re trying to escape.Try to expand your happy placeWhile your happy place should be your very own, private, calming space, there is a lesson to be learnt from what makes it work for you. If you can work out what the characteristics that contribute to your happiness are, you can try to introduce them into the rest of the spaces that you occupy every day.For instance, if you find it calming to be amongst greenery, you can get an office plant on your desk. If you like to unwind by walking, you can try to schedule in a walk around the block twice a day. And if you like to escape by reading a book in bed, try to go to bed an hour earlier every night to fit in those precious minutes of personal time.While it\"s important to have somewhere to escape to, it\"s just as important to be able to find calming influences in all aspects of your life."

        "content": "As part of its commitment to support and help grow female-owned and run businesses in South Africa, 1st for Women is a proud sponsor of KAMERS vol geskenke  SA\"s pop-up treasure trove of handcrafted creativity. If you had a chance to attend the shows in Cape Town and Joburg recently, you\"ll know that this prestigious event showcases the best creative talent South Africa has to offer. By doing this, the show plays an integral part in giving female entrepreneurs the opportunity to turn their passions into profitable business ventures. According to its organisers, 95% of KAMERS traders are women who regard the pop-up market\" as a respected and well-organised space to sell their wares.To contextualise just how important the event is, the South African Women Entrepreneurs\" Network confirms that approximately 70% of informal businesses in South Africa are owned or controlled by women. At the same time, only eight percent of SMEs in South Africa are owned by women, according to the 2014 SME Survey.Some of the reasons that many women don\"t make the leap from informal trading of goods and skills to establishing official small businesses are that they lack financial resources and networking opportunities and are hampered by gender stereotypes. But, considering that so many South African women are breadwinners or financial contributors to their households, they need to be able to access the support they need to become entrepreneurs.One of the areas in which women can access financial support is that of insurance for women business owners. Women feel all too keenly the stresses of financial responsibility and their obligation to their employees and their families. This means that taking on the financial demands of owning and running a business can be challenging.While nothing can take away the pain and thrill of these responsibilities, having business insurance in place to prepare for any eventuality does buy peace of mind and, should the worst befall your business, the support when you need it the most.All the insurance you needWhen you run your own business, you need to consider the following types of cover, to ensure that you will be able to meet all your legal, financial and moral obligations: Cover for damages to your business property from events such as fire, wind or flooding,Cover for business interruption should your business be unable to meet its obligations for whatever reasonGeneral liability, which means that you are covered for damage to another person or another person\"s property in the course of your business,Professional liability, which protects you financially from claims against you for negligence, errors, omissions or wrongful acts in the performance of your duties,Commercial vehicle insurance for any vehicles that are used by your business or your employees,Equipment insurance for the loss or repair of any equipment used in the running of your businessHealth, medical, life, disability, unemployment and workmen\"s compensation insurance for you and your staff.Get the cover to suit your businessDon\"t worry if this seems like a staggering array of different types of complex insurance products. Most insurers offer at least some of these types of cover packaged into one product that\"s suited to your needs. For example, 1st for Women offers the following products:1st for Business Women This product has been designed for women who own a florist, hairdressing or beauty salon, book shop, coffee shop, a retail outlet or a garden service, for example.1st for Professional Women If you own a law, accountancy, auditing, brokerage or consultancy firm, this product has been specially tailored for you.1st for Women in Practice This product is best suited to doctors, dentists, physiotherapists, optometrists, veterinary surgeons and psychiatrists, for example.1st for Executive Women This product has been designed for women who own a travel or estate agency, a general office, training centre or internet cafe, for example.Take the plunge! Getting into business requires 50% careful planning and 50% nerves of steel. But having the right insurance products in place will protect you and your fledgling business from any hardships that might befall it, allowing you to focus on growing your market share and tending to your customers. With business cover, you can take confident strides into the world of business ownership and take your place among the entrepreneurs in South Africa.Look forward to more creative excellence at KAMERS Watch this space for details on the upcoming KAMERS events taking place in Hermanus (24-27 September); Stellenbosch (27 October - 1 November); and at Open Window Irene in Pretoria (1-6 December)."

        "content": "It\"s part of the job description of a mother to always want to do more, be better, focus harder and spend more time. At the same time, the media and your friends can often make you feel like you\"re not doing nearly enough to be the perfect mother who never loses her cool, has a yoga-toned body and whose children excel in maths and music. Some days, you just feel like a bad mother and it\"s all you can do to get to wine o\" clock.But while there really are bad mothers in the world (of course there are), chances are that if you\"re reading this article and worrying about it, then you aren\"t one of them. Most of the time, all children need is love and food, and if you\"ve covered those bases the rest just falls into place. In fact, you probably don\"t even realise what a great mom you are!To remind you, this Mother\"s Day, here are some of the ways you\"re doing a fabulous job even though you probably don\"t even notice:Every day, you organise their lives Until you had kids, you were responsible for yourself. Sure, you might worked for someone or supported a partner or looked after your own mum but that\"s just a drop in the ocean compared to the hard work of being totally and utterly responsible for every aspect of another human being\"s life. From wiping noses to doing school lifts, you\"re making their lives possible every day. Well done!You know what they like and you feed it to them When you\"re shopping for groceries, you think of the things that they like and the things that they don\"t. You cut the crusts off their sandwiches and boil their eggs just right. You pack their favourite fruit in their lunchtins, and every now and then you give them the perfect treat. That\"s a whole lot of consideration going on right there.You\"re their go-to gal If they scrape their knees or someone else hurts their feelings, nothing makes it better faster than a hug from mom. You\"ll always put down whatever it is you\"re doing to give them what they need, even if it\"s not at the most convenient of times (like when you\"re leaving for a meeting or chopping an onion).You put their happiness and development first  Moms think about their kids before they think of anyone else. It started when they were tiny babies and you often forgot to go to the loo and carried on later when you limited your own social life to make sure they finished their homework. It isn\"t always fun, but you\"re giving of yourself every waking moment (and plenty of the sleeping ones too).And here are some that might surprise you While having children is an exercise in sacrifice (even though it has its enormous rewards), sometimes you\"re even helping them grow when you get it all wrong. Here are some of the things that you probably beat yourself up about and the reasons why you shouldn\"t.Your house is in a mess You\"ve taught your children that everyone\"s human and that there are more important things than perfectly arranged sofa cushions. You\"ve let them feel comfortable in their own home, and shown them that their presence (and all that comes with it) is a welcome part of your life.You lost your temper You showed them that people are fallible, and you taught them a boundary if they push that button one too many times, sometimes even the people that love them the most can snap. Kiss and make up and DON\"T BEAT YOURSELF UP ABOUT IT.You snuck away for a quiet coffee You taught your children that everyone needs space, and that they sometimes need to fend for themselves, just for a little while. And didn\"t you feel re-energised and ready to tackle the bedtime challenges because you treated yourself? Remember that sometimes it\"s good to be selfish, just for a bit.Take the good with the bad As their mother, you are the model for all the other relationships that your children will ever have. That doesn\"t mean you should teach them to expect perfection and sacrifice; rather, you should be showing them the value of give and take, mutual care and encouragement, and consideration and respect. You\"re probably already doing a brilliant job. "

        "description": "",
        "content": "Kids have so much to learn. And as mothers, we have so much to teach them. But somehow in those first precious moments of being a parent and for the rest of our lives, we are learning just as much from them as they are from us. It may not always feel like it when you are sleep starved and rushed off your feet, but your knowledge and understanding is growing every day. We gathered ten of the greatest lessons that mothers learn from their kids to remind you that you are on a mind-expanding journey. 1. The art of humilityAll those things you said you\"d never do. How many times have you caught yourself doing them? This week? No matter how much of a perfectionist, planner or organiser you are, you\"ll find your best-laid plans derailed with the arrival of a small person. You learn to roll with it.2. To see the world through a child\"s eyesChildren see things differently from adults, and by trying to understand their little worlds we open up a universe of comprehension. So stop and appreciate their view be it of a snail or politics you\"ll find your horizons broadened.3. To be infinitely patientIf you ask any mother, she\"ll tell you that patient is the last thing that she is. But actually, behind all the hurrying and the tending to needs and the nagging, every mother has learnt to incorporate someone else\"s entire life into her own and that takes patience, even if you don\"t always feel that it does.4. New levels of creativity (or the art of the white lie)Whether you\"re answering the same question for the four hundred and fifty seventh time, creating a meal of dinosaur eggs and dragon claws or finding ways to explain away a hurtful truth, motherhood challenges your grey matter. You may have forgotten what time it is or where the keys are, but your neurons are still firing at lightning speed.5. That there\"s a lioness within youYou might gripe about your kids, or despair at the state of your sofa, but if anyone else says a bad word about them or does anything to hurt them, you surprise yourself with the ferocity that rises in your chest and tingles in your fingertips. That\"s the maternal instinct, and it can flatten armies and move mountains.6. Your prioritiesUntil you have children, you think you understand priorities. Then your children are born, and you find yourself torn between living every precious moment in the now, and worrying about every second of the future. You have to earn enough, save enough, spend enough time with your children, be fully committed to work and make sure you leave something behind for the next generation. You\"ll spend the rest of your life trying to work this out.7. That it isn\"t possible to swear quietly enoughThey are listening. They are always listening. Even when you think they\"re not listening, they are listening. From swearing to griping about your mother-in-law, you learn that if you have to do it, you do it when you\"re in a different postcode to your children.8. To always respect the needs of othersSpeak to any mother who has broken a biscuit in half, pushed a lift button or opened a yoghurt herself, and she\"ll tell you that the resulting meltdown wasn\"t worth it. You\"ll learn to cater to and pre-empt the needs of others no matter how outlandish or unreasonable and to THINK BEFORE YOU ACT.9. The gentle art of negotiationTeeth brushing, bed time or dinner BEFORE dessert. Any mother will tell you that these things are not achieved easily. To get there, you\"ve had to learn how to tip the scales subtly in favour of your preferred outcome. Your next salary negotiation will be a breeze.10. The awesome explosion of limitless loveYou think you\"ve loved before now. You think you\"ve understood what it\"s like to care for someone other than yourself. The moment you hold your child in your arms (or sometime in those first few weeks), you suddenly realise that a whole new universe of emotion you didn\"t know you were capable of is now open to you. Whatever they do, whatever they put you through, nothing can take away the overwhelming and infinite love you feel for them. Even when they throw your iPad in the bath. Even then. OK, maybe not then.

        "content": "Terrible traffic, the high cost of fuel and the slow pace of public transport are factors that many women have to contend with when getting themselves around a city. But there is a way to get past all these obstacles and be the coolest gal on the block as well and that is by buying yourself a scooter.Scooters are affordable, cost efficient to run and are now considered so stylish that they instantly convert any stretch of tarmac into a catwalk. If you need to deal with your transport woes, you\"d be wise to give scooters serious consideration. Here\"s why:They cost next to nothing A brand-new scooter can cost as little as R8 000, with even top of the range models coming in at under R20 000. This means, at the cheaper end, that a scooter can be financed for as little as R310 per month. Even if you add fuel and insurance costs, this still works out cheaper than almost any car and most public transport options.  You\"ll save on fuel While fuel costs vary wildly from car to car and scooter to scooter, some assessments say that you get five times more mileage to your fuel on a scooter than in a car. So the savings you get in running costs are enough to slash your fuel budget down by four fifths. And this will become even more important as the fuel price goes up.You\"ll beat the traffic Because you can pass cars in traffic jams, zippy little scooters generally get you through your rush-hour commute faster than any car would manage. Of course, it\"s important to be a responsible and cautious driver, but those extra minutes you gain every day are one of the main reasons that people love their scooters.Scooters are stylin\" We\"ve mentioned this already, but scooters have a whole new hipster appeal. In the past, scooters might have been considered cheap and nasty, now they have their own space in the cool market. If you own one, you\"ll be the hottest thing on two wheels (other than all the other scooter riders).You\"ll be doing less harm to the environment While scooters may not have the most efficient emission reduction technology, the lower amount of fuel required to power them naturally makes for lower emissions. Building, running and recycling scooters all cause less harm to the environment than the same processes for a car (unless that car is a bus full of people who would otherwise each be driving cars).It\"s easy to get started In South Africa, you need a motorbike learner\"s licence or motorbike driver\"s licence to ride a scooter. If you want to carry passengers, you will need the full motorbike driver\"s licence. The learner\"s licence is just a simple written test, and some scooter sellers even offer you coaching to help you to pass. You do not need to have your licence to buy a scooter (but you will need one the moment you\"re on the road).And now for the downsides Unfortunately driving a scooter isn\"t all rose-pink hues and chrome finishes. There are some drawbacks, which it\"s important to be aware of. Safety is one of the leading concerns for scooter drivers, since other drivers often do silly things and scooters offer their riders almost no protection.Vehicle theft is also worth considering, although you can buy security products to make your scooter more secure and insurance to cover your loss. Your personal safety is also a concern, since you are more easily accessible to passersby and criminals.There are also practical considerations like the weather (although you can buy rain gear) and whether a large portion of your commute is on a highway. Scooters are allowed on the highways in South Africa, but at that speed and traffic density, riding could be unpleasant.So should you or shouldn\"t you?  Many scooter riders swear that buying their bike was the best thing that ever happened to them. However, scooters aren\"t for everyone. If you do a big daily commute on a highway, if you live somewhere with consistent bad weather, if you are extremely concerned about your safety on the road and if you frequently give lifts to other people, then a scooter probably wouldn\"t be the best option for you.However, if you want to reduce your costs of transport and vehicle ownership, avoid getting caught in heavy traffic and reduce your carbon emissions (and look darn cool while doing it), then get down your nearest scooter dealer for a test drive, right away!Get insured!  If you take the plunge and decide to buy your very own scooter, make sure you have the insurance you need! Find out more here. "

        "content": "There\"s no denying that women are judged by their appearances. But this doesn\"t mean that to be successful, happy or loved, we all have to dress in the same cookie-cutter style that ticks all the right boxes. While it\"s important to be aware of the impression you\"re projecting with your wardrobe, it is just as important to find your own way of expressing your personality through what you wear.At the same time, clothes aren\"t just an expression of who you are - they can actually influence you to act differently. A 2012 study from Northwestern University in the United States introduced a concept called enclothed cognition, which the researchers defined as the systematic influence that clothes have on the wearer\"s psychological processes.Simply put, if you put on a serious suit, killer stilettos and fierce red lipstick before you go into a meeting, your choice of clothes will have psychologically prepared you to take nonsense from no-one. In this way, the process of getting dressed every day is part of your mental preparation for that day.Getting dressed every day is an important ritual, says Georgina Simone Rawden, a fashion buyer and trend forecaster. Getting dressed for work motivates me and gives me confidence.She has the following tips to share for getting the most out of your wardrobe so that it brings out the best in you:Dress professionally, but add an individual touchDifferent industries have varying dress norms, but looking professional applies to all. Make small additions to bring your personality through, like adding accessories, a fabulous pair of shoes, a scarf that stands out or a good quality piece of jewellery that you wear every day that represents your own personal brand.Avoid the obvious problem areasThere are definitely a few no-nos in the workplace. Anything too tight, too short or too sexy is not a good look, and neither is anything too sloppy or unprofessional. Scruffy T-shits and old jeans do not a good impression make. Jeans are fine in creative industries, but dress them up with blouses, heels and accessories.Dress for comfort and confidence in a social settingFor casual braais with friends you can get away with just about anything. The best way to dress is by finding a look that makes you feel confident without being over the top, but don\"t be afraid to try something new.Rely on the classicsClassics are classics for a reason, so you can always fall back on (and keep wearing) something that doesn\"t date, rather than having to cycle through an entirely new wardrobe every season. But remember to add a touch of fashion in the form of seasonal colours, prints, bags and shoes to keep your look fresh.As an extension of this, people are still trying to master the capsule wardrobe, which essentially consists of a few stylish basics that can be dressed up or dressed down with accessories. For instance, white blouses, jeans, anything leather, good heels and good boots can be worn in so many different ways each season.Focus on the basics of groomingBeing immaculately groomed is not always essential, but having clean hair, fresh skin and a touch of make-up goes a long way to giving you confidence and creating a good impression.Above all, feel good about yourselfConfidence is often described as the most attractive characteristic, no matter what your gender. So let your clothes be your tools in supporting and expressing your own sense of self-worth. If you feel like a million bucks, chances are you\"ll project that. "

It\"s never fun to think about, but if you have this checklist up to date, you can live your life without worrying that your loved ones will have an uncertain future if something happens to you.Buy life coverIf you have dependents, it is vitally important that you have sufficient live cover in place to ensure that they do not suffer financially after you are gone. If you are young and healthy, life insurance isn\"t particularly costly.When working out how much cover you need, you should look at your children\"s expenses like schooling, medical bills, food and entertainment to work out how much they need each month, and then buy life cover to meet those needs. A financial planner or broker can help you to work out the specifics of what you\"ll need. And remember that if you pass away, a life insurance pay-out that names a specific beneficiary cannot be used by your estate to settle debt. It goes to your beneficiaries.If you have debt such as a bond or a credit card, most financial institutions offer or even insist that you have credit life insurance to cover what you owe. With this kind of cover in place, you will know that your estate will not be saddled with your debt, which means that your dependants will have a greater inheritance. It\"s important to know that while a lender can insist that you have credit life cover in place, they can\"t insist that you buy it from them, so shop around for competitive quotes.  Make a willYour will is simply a document stating how your assets must be divided and dealt with after your death. You don\"t need to see a lawyer or pay a fortune to draft a will. Simply use a template that you can find on the internet or purchase at a stationery shop, and sign it and have it witnessed. You can lodge the will with a lawyer or at a bank, or you can keep it in a safe in your house and it\"s a good idea to give a copy to a trusted family member as well. Remember to tell the relevant people where to find it.Your will should cover:Who will inherit your assets.Who should act as your executor. If your estate is worth less than R250 000, you can appoint an administrator, who doesn\"t have to follow the full procedures of the Administration of Estates Act, which are the legal processes for winding up an estate. For estates greater than R250 000, an executor must be appointed, who is either familiar with accountancy practices, or has the support of someone who understands financial law. This person must have indicated that they are willing to act as the executor.Whether and how a trust must be formed. This is important if you have dependent children who will inherit your assets. A trust should be formed, usually made up of three people (for example a family member from the mother\"s and father\"s side of the family and a third, neutral financial professional), who will decide, guided by your wishes, how those assets are handled while your children are underage.Who will act as your children\"s guardian. Make sure that you have given this careful thought and consulted with the individuals who you are going to appoint. Also remember to revisit this should the guardian\"s situation change. Don\"t worry about hurt feelings or family politics. Do what is best for your children. You may find this part very difficult to deal with, but it can be the most important conversation that you will ever have.Whether any charities should benefit from your estate.A list of all your bank accounts, investment products, existing policies and internet passwords so that your family can easily wind up your affairs.You should also have a document called a living will to state what your wishes about being kept alive by artificial means (life support) in the event that you are unable to communicate and have no hope of recovering.Plan your funeralIt helps your family immensely to be able to act on your wishes about how to bid you farewell. You can state requirements like whether you should be buried or cremated, where you would like the memorial service to be held, whom you would like to speak, any readings you would like read or any other information that would be useful to loved ones who would like to carry out your last wishes. It can also be surprisingly expensive to bury someone, so it helps to have a funeral policy in place to deal with these specific financial requirements. Get it done!While considering your death may not be the most uplifting way to spend your time, knowing that your loved ones will be cared for and your last wishes will be carried out will give you the peace of mind to live your life fully. Don\"t delay the process; make the time and then do it and remember to revisit your will once a year or when your circumstances change, just to be sure that your requests and bequests are still up to date.

        "content": "You\"re sick and tired of working your fingers to the bone to make someone else\"s business a success. You don\"t want to be answerable to anybody else. You want to experience the thrill of creating something and making a go of it. You have the spirit of entrepreneurship and you want to start your own business, now!Having the spirit is all well and good, but of course, making a success of your business takes a lot more than just passion. Before you make any kind of financial commitment, you need to do your research so that you know what you\"re getting into and what you can expect to get out of it.There is a wealth of information online tools, websites and apps that will help you to build your business from the ground up. But to get you started, you can ask yourself these five simple questions. If you come up with a blank in response to any of them, you know you need to give it a lot more thought before you set out to become your own boss.1. What will my business offer that no other business does?This is the single most important question you need to ask yourself when you\"re starting a business. In business speak, it\"s called identifying your unique selling point. If you don\"t have one, then you don\"t have a business, because there\"s no point in opening the doors of an enterprise that just does the same thing as everyone else.Remember that location, an improvement on existing offerings or an ability to tap a new market are all unique selling points as well, so you don\"t have to come up with something entirely new just something that you have the conviction that you can sell because it\"s better.2. How will I finance my business?Getting a small business started almost always requires some funding. The first step is to approach your bank to find out about their small business financing options. If you do not qualify for a loan through the normal banking channels, ask about specific funding opportunities for women. For example, the Absa Women Empowerment Fund and Nedbank\"s arrangement with Khula Enterprise Finance offer funding for women small business owners.The Department of Trade and Industry and the Small Enterprise Development Agency also have some funding programmes for women.3. Have I investigated all the costs of owning a business?There are the obvious costs of starting a business like property rental and equipment costs which you\"ve probably thought of.  But there are other costs you might not have considered, such as trading licences, accounting fees for your business\"s taxes, legal fees, staff costs and business insurance. Don\"t go into the process with blinkers on; be honest with yourself about what the actual requirements, needs and expenses are. Draw up a carefully researched budget and make sure that you have some kind of plan to cover all your business expenses.4. How will I survive until the business gets off the ground?Since the whole point of the business should be enriching yourself, a large part of your business plan should cover how you intend to cover your personal expenses before your business turns a profit. You may have to look at ways in which you can tighten your belt instead of dreaming about the flashy new car that you\"re going to buy with your entrepreneurial riches. And don\"t count on your family to support yourself if you haven\"t asked them upfront.It\"s extremely useful if you can keep your day job while starting your business, and only throw yourself fully into your small enterprise when your business is breaking even. Here are some tips from the Small Enterprise Development Agency about starting a business without working capital.5. How will I market my business?You can\"t just open the doors of your business and expect it to be an overnight success. Marketing is the single most important thing you can do to get your business off the ground. Make sure that you have a plan for getting the right sort of people through your doors. Whether you ask friends to hand out flyers to their friends, have a big opening party with loads of special offers or buy advertising space in your community newspaper, you need to have a plan, have the money to execute it, and be willing to change it if it isn\"t working.Be cautious, but don\"t be afraidThere are few better feelings in the world than making a success of your own business. But success isn\"t guaranteed, so it is vitally important that you plan carefully before leaping into an independent venture, so that you and your business can move into the future with confidence and security.Have you started a business?Click here for more information on First for Women business insurance"

        "description": "",
        "content": "You\"ve seen the headlines:  Sitting is killing you! or Sitting is the new smoking! While no one ever believed that sitting at a desk all day was good for you, this latest string of revelations comes from a report by the University in Regensburg in Germany that sitting increases your chances of getting certain types of cancer. This is in addition to the increase in obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases, as well as the damage to your skeletal and muscular system associated with sticking to your chair all day.The findings, which were a little scary, suggested the following: For each day, every two-hour increase in sitting time means an 8% increase in the risk of colon cancer, a 10% risk increase for endometrial cancer and a 6% increase in your chances of contracting lung cancer.And here\"s what\"s really infuriating for people who stay fit even regular exercise doesn\"t offset the increase in risks associated with being at your desk all day. So if that 6am spinning class isn\"t actually doing much to counteract the damage of sitting, what can you do to limit the harm you\"re doing to yourself?Here are the five things you should incorporate into your desk time to reduce the risks that you are exposing yourself to (since most of us don\"t have the money or space for a walking workstation):1. Get your workstation rightThe relationship between the positions of your body, neck, hands and feet when sitting have a considerable impact on how you feel by the end of the day. Obviously, maintaining a good posture and symmetrical base are choices, but you can support your choices by positioning your desk, chair and computer correctly.The basic rules of ergonomics as outlined by the UK\"s National Health Service state:Support your lower back. Get a chair with built-in lumbar support, or buy a strap-on cushion to help you sit in the right position.Adjust your chair so that your knees are level with your hips, and you can use your keyboard with your wrists and forearms straight and parallel to the floor. Your elbows should be at the side of your body, so that your arm forms an L shape.Your feet should also be flat on the floor. If you can\"t achieve all of this with your current chair-desk situation, you may need to set your chair higher and get a footrest (old phone directories will do).Place your screen at eye level. Again, you may need a stand or phone directory.Your keyboard should be directly in front of you when you are typing, with around 10 to 15cm of the front of the desk showing for you to rest your wrists on. Your wrists should not be bent when using the keyboard. You can use a wrist wrest, and it may help to connect an external keyboard to your laptop.Keep your mouse as close to you as possible, so you\"re not extending the muscles of your arm and neck to use it.2. Change your position regularlyThere is a school of thought that says it\"s not how you sit, but how long you sit in one position that\"s the real problem. There are many different office chair options, but if you can find a way to switch between, for instance, a regular chair, an office chair and a pilates ball throughout the day, you\"ll be activating different muscle groups and relieving some of the strain.  Likewise, you could sit at your desk, stand at a counter or work in a coffee shop for variety (and good coffee).3. Take regular breaksEvery time you leave the sitting position, you release and relieve your body. Just taking a brisk walk from one end of the passage to the other will get your blood pumping to your muscles and will reduce the pressure on your organs and skeleton. Try to do this once an hour. And don\"t eat at your desk.4. Do desk exercisesWhen you\"re taking your hourly break, it can also help to do specific exercises to counter the strain of sitting. You don\"t need to drop and do 20 push-ups; simply looking up at the ceiling releases your neck muscles and shrugging your shoulders does the same for your upper back. Leg extensions and hip rotations also work wonders for a cramped frame.Most people know where they are holding tension and how to release it, but if you need some guidance, check out these suggestions from WebMD.5. Choose to moveWhile one hour-long exercise session in the morning does little to reduce some of the risks associated with sitting for the rest of the day, keeping active throughout the day does. You may think that you don\"t have much chance to move around, but if you make mobility a priority, you\"ll be surprised at how many opportunities you\"ll find. Take the stairs instead of the lift, walk instead of drive and don\"t ask other people to get you a cup of coffee while they\"re in the kitchen. And if you work in a small or home office, you can buy a mini-trampoline for an enjoyable burst of activity during breaks throughout the day.You could also buy a Fitbit to help you set goals and measure your activity progress, or there are a number of apps you can download to your phone if you\"re serious about keeping moving.Sit wellUnless you can radically change your career, sitting at work is here to stay for most people. But if you accept that this isn\"t the best thing for you, and look for alternatives or solutions, you\"ll find that your health, your mental wellness and your lifestyle improves."

        "content": "From 11 to 13 July 2014, Zelda La Grange, DJ Fresh, Saint Seseli, Angie Khumalo, Anele Mdoda, Alex Caige, Clint Cunningham and Johrne van Huyssteen donned helmets to take part in another Bikers for Mandela Day event. 1st for Women Insurance, via its charitable trust, the 1st for Women Foundation, supported the group of bikers on their 2014 Bikers for Mandela Day journey. According to Zelda La Grange, Madiba’s former assistant and the Patron of the 1st for Women Foundation, “In South Africa, violence against women continues, unabated. With this in mind, we dedicated our 2014 journey to the survivors of gender-based violence. We want to encourage more women to speak out, to take action, to follow through so that their perpetrators can be brought to book.” The bikers that participated in the initiative supported organisations that assist survivors of gender based violence and rape in Diepsloot, Vryburg, Kimberley and Bloemfontein. They were joined by a large contingent of local bikers. “Since 2005, the 1st for Women Foundation has donated over R30 million to a number of women-related charity organisations that focus on gender-based violence and cervical cancer. Thanks to our customers who automatically donate a portion of their monthly insurance premium to the 1st for Women Foundation, we have managed to help over 150 000 survivors of gender-based violence through public advocacy training, community dialogues and workshops. Bikers for Mandela Day is another way for us to give back, to illustrate the collective power of women and to make a tangible difference,” says Robyn Farrell, Executive Head of 1st for Women Insurance. On 11 July 2014, the biker team departed from 1st for Women’s head office in Fourways and headed for Diepsloot. There, they partnered with the founder of 67 Blankets for Nelson Mandela Day, Carolyn Steyn, and Afrika Tikkun, an organisation that is dedicated to investing in education, health and social services for children, youth and their families through its community centres of excellence and strategic partnerships. At Afrika Tikkun, the team distributed hand-made blankets to 67 Diepsloot-based beneficiaries. From Diepsloot, they headed off to the Caritas Community Focus organisation in Vryburg. There, the team spent 67 minutes packing rape survivor care kits and painting the organisation’s contact details, and anti-abuse artwork, on the perimeter wall. The 1st for Women Foundation also handed over a cheque for R100 000 to Caritas Community Focus. This organisation is dedicated to ensuring the well-being of those affected by poverty, drug abuse and domestic violence. On 12 July 2014, the bikers travelled to Kimberley and, for 67 minutes, spent time packing rape survivor care kits and cleaning up the grounds at the Grace Divine Outreach Centre. The 1st for Women Foundation also handed over a cheque for R100 000 to the Centre. The Outreach Centre provides short-term safe house accommodation for rape survivors and offers the survivors counselling, court preparation and support, HIV testing and counselling and aftercare services in association with the Galeshewe Thuthuzela Care Centre. On 13 July 2014, the team stopped over at the Nelson Mandela statue at Naval Hill in Bloemfontein. With this being the 1st Bikers for Mandela Day since Nelson Mandela\"s passing, the bikers stopped here to lay down 67 roses and have a moment of silence in Madiba’s memory. Thereafter they headed off to support Bloem Shelter. This shelter cares for 90 to 100 homeless people daily and provides accommodation for babies, pregnant women, children, families, single women, the elderly and men. The reasons why people are taken to Bloem Shelter include abuse, addiction, financial difficulties, mental problems and human trafficking. At this organisation, the bikers spent 67 minutes painting a jungle gym, painting the perimeter wall, filling the sandpit, painting the roof to a newly constructed undercover parking, fitting a new washing line and fitting brand new grocery shelves to the pantry. The 1st for Women Foundation also handed over a cheque for R100 000 to the Shelter. “We encourage all South Africans to make every day a Mandela Day. There are so many simple ways we can do this and the great thing is that it doesn’t necessarily have to cost a cent. Acts of kindness like volunteering at your local charity organisation or reading to those that can’t – it all counts,” says La Grange."

        "content": "New Year\"s morning is like a clean slate. You can put the excesses of the previous year (and the December holiday) behind you and make a fresh start. The world is your oyster and you can be anything you want to be all you have to do is stick to your New Year\"s resolutions. And that\"s where the problem usually startsResearch suggests that only 8% of people who make resolutions actually stick to them. Those aren\"t particularly encouraging odds. It\"s easy to make a resolution at the tail end of a holiday, but as soon as you get back into the rut of work and life and earning and having no time, your resolution becomes next year\"s problem. Again. But it doesn\"t have to be that way. You can improve your chances of New Year\"s resolution success with this advice:1. Make your resolution achievable and measurable There\"s no point in resolving to be a millionaire by 31 December 2015 if your only way of getting there is winning the lottery. Likewise, get fit is pointless if you can convince yourself you\"ve achieved it by walking once around the block in January. Carefully research any target you set yourself to make sure that it\"s realistic. And then state an actual measurable outcome that you want to achieve, like saving 10% of your salary for ten months or being able to run 9km in an hour by June.2. Identify the hurdles Most of us know how we want to improve in the coming year but it\"s also important to look back and work out what prevented us from getting there in the last 12 months.  They say that a definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, so if you haven\"t changed your process, you can\"t expect a different outcome. Look at the obstacles that stood in your way and make plans for blasting through them in 2015. No time for gym? Arrange morning lifts for the kids. Eat junk when you\"re hungry? Take a healthy snack box to work every day.3. Set short-term goals, with short-term rewards Break your ultimate goal down into shorter, more easily achievable milestones and give yourself little rewards along the way for achieving them. A 10kg weight loss in 12 months seems unachievable and very far away on 1 January, but if you allow yourself a little treat every time you lose a kilo in under a month, you\"ll feel motivated to stick to your path.4. Go public This is a controversial point and it doesn\"t work for everyone, but if you\"re the kind of person who likes to share your story and enlist the involvement of your friends, then announce your resolution on social media the moment the second hand ticks past midnight. Then share regular monthly updates detailing the trials and joys of your journey towards your goal. You\"ll find the support of your friends is a great motivator and the fear or admitting to failure is a great deterrent.5. Don\"t plan for the setbacks, but allow for them Don\"t start the journey intending to fail, but if you do fall off the resolution wagon and have a cigarette, blow your salary or miss a week of gym, don\"t give up. Accept that it happened, dust yourself off and get back on track. Don\"t let small setbacks become massive failures. Make it part of your resolution at the outset to get back up every time you fall.Good luck and happy New Year  We know it isn\"t easy, but if you approach it right and enjoy the process, self-improvement can be extremely rewarding. Pin your resolutions down with these tips and go into 2015 with the courage to achieve your resolutions because you have a roadmap for getting there."

        "content": "December is a rough month for your finances. Even if you\"ve done all the right things like made a budget and stayed out of credit, your bank balance probably isn\"t looking terribly pretty right now. And you have the whole of January to get through. What\"s a girl to do?The single most important thing to do is avoid getting into debt. January is a tough month, but if you can avoid spending more than you have, you won\"t spend the rest of the year paying it back. Here are 10 ways to stretch your budget until the next payday.1. Do a budgetOf course, to stretch your budget, the first thing you need to do is work out how much money you have. Look at your bank account (stay calm), and calculate how much money you can spend each week to get you to the end of the month. Then don\"t spend a cent more.2. Host a pot-luck dinner for friendsDecember\"s done, you\"ve had your fun. Now settle in at home to save some cash. Invite your friends around for a pot-luck dinner where everyone brings along one item to share.3. Television is your new best friendThere\"s more good television out there than any reasonably sociable person can get through in a year. January is your freebie month for being a couch potato. Download or borrow all the series and movies you\"ve been meaning to catch up on, microwave a bag of popcorn and go!4. Cook cheaplyPlan your meals for the next month carefully. Focus on healthy, hearty options that you can cook one night and then adapt for a couple of days afterwards. Roast a chicken then use the leftovers in a tortilla the next day, and cook up the remains into a soup the day after that. You can visit blogs like Easy Cooking from Nina\"s Kitchen for inspiration on delicious, affordable food. And remember to pack a lunchbox of leftovers for work each day.5. Give up an expensive habitYou must have some little indulgences that keep you going your daily cappuccino, your game credits on your phone, your data usage when you\"re not in a wifi zone, your monthly visit to the nail barâ€¦ Whatever your vice, put it aside or find a cheaper alternative for one month.6. Earn some extra cashIf you have any skills that you could press into service in this tough month, go ahead. Whether you can offer babysitting in your neighbourhood, bake cakes or curries to order or host a jumble sale to get rid of old clothes, there are many ways to earn a little extra cash to make ends meet. Be proactive and market yourself, and you may even find that you can earn a little extra for the rest of the year as well.7. Plan inexpensive outings for kids (and adults)Keeping kids busy and entertained is an expensive business. But it doesn\"t have to be. There are many free and affordable outings to be enjoyed if you set your mind to it from a picnic at a local park or beach to a visit to a museum or gallery. You can check this list out for some ideas in Johannesburg. And it\"s not just the kids who will have a great timeâ€¦8. Cash in your loyalty pointsLast but certainly not least, now might be just the right time to cash in your loyalty points. Use your eBucks or your Dis-Chem points to buy what you need to see you through January - debt free!You can do it! Remember that your primary goal is to get through January without slipping into debt. If you manage it, your salary at the end of the month will be yours for the keeping and you can treat yourself to a bit of a splurge in celebration."

        "content": "For most people, being in a relationship is a must-have item on the happiness list. But, as difficult as it might sometimes be, there\"s a lot to be said for being single. If you\"re on the singles train, grab the opportunity to invest in yourself and broaden your horizons. Here are seven reasons why it\"s great to be single.1. You have all that free timeYour time is your own. You don\"t have to be somewhere because someone else is. You can do whatever you like without having to consult with anyone.  Make it work for you: Hang out at the mall, spend an hour in a bookshop or work late just to get the job done. Do it all at a pace that suits you.2. You can do it your own way Life with a partner is about compromise. Any coupled person will be able to tell you the one thing about their partner that drives them insane and it\"s usually something small like not screwing on the toothpaste lid. When you\"re single, you can run your life and your household the way that you want to without having to accommodate anyone else.Make it work for you: Buy some gorgeous new bedding and organise your bedroom just the way you like it.3. You can go a bit wild Almost everyone settles down and leaves their jolling behind them as they get older, and being part of a couple speeds up this process. Why go out when you can stay in and cuddle? But when single-you has the choice between being alone at home or painting the town red, red\"s going to win every time.Make it work for you: Put on your dancing shoes, grab a bottle of champagne and call a taxi!4. You can catch up with your friendsEven if you made a lot of time for your friends when you were in a relationship, when you\"re single your partner isn\"t making any demands on your time. You can stay out all night with your mates on Friday and then hook up with them again on Saturday afternoon.Make it work for you: Call your friends and make plans for a spa day or a weekend away.5. You can do that thing you\"ve always meant to Whether you wanted to start a dance class, travel to India or learn French, it\"s always tougher to take on a new hobby or responsibility when there\"s someone else to spend time with. Use your single time to learn new things and keep yourself busy.Make it work for you: Sign up for a course, buy a new yoga outfit and use it or start saving up for a round-the-world ticket.6. You can date The nice thing about being newly single is that you can avoid the constraints of long-term commitment by dating casually. Online dating offers you a wealth of people to meet and you can stipulate the terms of your encounter. Obviously, it\"s important to be safe, so always let a friend know where you\"re going and who you\"re with if you\"re meeting a stranger.Make it work for you: Create an irresistible online profile and set up your first coffee date for this weekend.7. You\"ll learn a lot about yourself When you spend all that time alone with yourself, you get in touch with who you really are. You can fine tune your likes and dislikes, confront your faults and learn to love yourself.Make it work for you: While it\"s good to keep busy, try to schedule in some quiet me time and spend it in your own company, doing things you love.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Malls have become targets for criminal activity in South Africa. In the Cape in the last six weeks there have been more than 15 armed robberies in malls and the rest of the country isn\"t lagging far behind. With the festive season ahead of us, it pays to take some safety measures and keep your wits about you when you hit the shops. Here are five tips to keep you safe at the shops, especially among the holiday crowds.1. Be aware Malls are designed to distract you. Every shop front, restaurant and display clamours for your attention. If you know that you become scattered and inattentive at shopping centres, rein yourself in. Make a list before you go, plan your route and try to stay aware of your personal space and possessions and especially your children at all times.2. Keep your handbag close The safest way to carry a bag is with a strap diagonally across your body, and with all zips and pockets closed. The extra seconds it takes you to open and close your bag properly each time you need something could save you hours of heartache if your wallet and cell phone are stolen. Remember that thieves will try to distract you, so don\"t be taken in by attempts to engage or jostle you. Women are as likely as men to pickpocket you, so don\"t let your guard down.3. Banks Any time that you visit a bank but especially at month-end when you\"re likely to withdraw a large bundle of cash be extra vigilant. Put the money away quickly and carefully and proceed to your next destination whether it\"s your car or a shop directly. If you are feeling anxious for any reason, ask the mall security to accompany you.4. Restaurants  If you stop for a bite to eat, don\"t let your vigilance lapse. It\"s very easy for thieves to swipe your stuff when you\"re focused on your chicken salad or cappuccino. If a restaurant offers those under-the-table hooks to hang your handbag from, use them. Otherwise put your bag on your lap or on a chair that\"s in your line of sight but not accessible to the flow of human traffic.5. If you are in an armed robbery In the terrifying event that you are held up in a shop or a bank, take note of these safety measures:Do your best to stay calm and avoid eye contact even if you are threatenedIf you have children with you, hold them close and try to keep them calmHand over any valuables to the robbers at their requestDon\"t try to be a hero or to escapeListen carefully to try and pick up clues that may help the police in their investigationsSeek trauma counseling after the robbery. You may feel fine or relieved in the short term, but trauma can take months to become obvious.6. Parking lots  Parking lots are often the places where you are at your most vulnerable because you are carrying shopping, paying for your parking, fumbling with your bags, looking for car keys, searching for your car and then unloading your trolley. Don\"t forget the tips for keeping your handbag safe just because you\"re nearly home free. If an attendant helps you to unload your bags, remember to keep an eye on your belongings. And if your car is in an isolated spot, ask a security guard to accompany you. Don\"t let your vigilance lapse when you leave the parking lot either. Thieves can trace your movements in a mall and follow you home. If you have any reason to believe you are being followed, drive straight to your nearest police station.Don\"t live in fear The purpose of these tips is to keep you vigilant when you need to be, but is not intended to make you fearful every time you visit the shops. Malls generally have good security measures that include CCTV and security guards, so while it\"s advisable to be careful you should still be able to relax and have fun. "

        "content": "You\"re packing your bags for the long haul down to the coast and you should be looking forward to the wonderful time you\"ll soon be having. Instead, because crime is a reality in South Africa, you\"re preoccupied with the security of your home while you\"ll be away.It\"s an unfortunate fact that incidents of burglary increase by 8% in December in South Africa (in addition to an increase in the months leading up the festive season), and when we go away the likelihood of our homes being broken into increases considerably. That\"s not a pleasant thought when you\"re heading away for a well-earned break, but there are some steps you can take to increase the security of your home over December.Service your alarm system and tell your security company you\"ll be away If you have an alarm installed in your house, it\"s very easy to get lulled into the false sense of security that it works just fine. It\"s a complex electronic system and it needs maintenance. Call your security company to let them know you\"ll be testing it then check that each room or entry point triggers a response. Many security companies will do this test and maintenance for you for free or for a nominal call-out fee.If you don\"t have an alarm system, it\"s a good idea to get some quotes. Many security companies will offer a free installation if you sign up with them but be careful of getting caught up in a lengthy contract as a result.You should also let your security company know that you\"ll be away, ask them to do extra patrols and give them your contact numbers. Put a plan in place so that if anyone needs to get into your property they can leave keys with a friend or neighbour.Get the security basics right No amount of pre-holiday planning can make up for a house that\"s badly secured to start with. The South African Police Service offers these detailed steps for securing your home, all year around. Some of the most relevant points to bear in mind are that you should put away all garden tools that could be used to smash a window or jack open a sliding door, put up an electric fence or razor wire around the perimeter and install motion detection lights and security gates across doorways. Again, before you go on holiday, make sure that your perimeter is secure by walking around the exterior of your property and making plans to fix any vulnerable points in your fence or gates.Put your valuables away When you go away, make sure you put all your valuables like jewelry, spare keys and electronic items in a safe, along with your important documents like marriage and birth certificates and passports (if you\"re not using them). If your house is broken into, at least you won\"t have to face the heartbreak of losing your grandmother\"s jewelry or the admin of replacing your paperwork.Arrange a presence on the property Having a trusted house sitter stay in your home is the best kind of security, but not everyone can find or afford to have someone stay while they are on holiday. If you don\"t have a trusted friend or cousin and can\"t get a professional house sitter, consider arranging to have someone drop in once or twice a day to switch lights on and off and make sure the house looks lived in. It\"s a good idea for this person to come at different times, so that no prospective burglar can learn their routine.This person can also clear accumulated mail in the post box a dead giveaway that no one\"s home and do other simple tasks like clearing away leaves and debris from the driveway and entrance.Get in touch with the neighbours Even if you aren\"t friendly with your neighbours, you should let them know that you\"ll be away and when you\"ll be back. Give them the numbers where you can be reached and provide them with a description of any person that is allowed onto your property.Ensure holiday safety You\"re probably worried about leaving your home alone while you\"re away, but many people forget that they are also at risk at their holiday destinations. Don\"t become tourist blind and ignore the risks while you\"re on vacation. Speak to the locals about safety at night and in remote areas before embarking on any adventures and secure your holiday home exactly as you would your actual home.And remember to be vigilant of your personal belongings when you are on the beach or sightseeing and it\"s easy to get distracted.Make sure you\"re covered  While all these tips are focused on preventing theft and break-ins, unfortunately, no matter how careful you are, sometimes bad things do happen. In the event that this happens to you, it will be far easier to pick up the pieces if you have the appropriate insurance in place. Speak to your insurer to make sure that your household contents are adequately insured, and that you have cover for any portables you are taking away with you.You can also get insurance for caravans, trailers and motorbikes, so be sure to keep your policy up to date.Stay safe Remember that the most important thing about taking a holiday is returning safely to a home that\"s as you left it. Don\"t take any unnecessary risks over the holiday season, look after yourself and don\"t drink and drive. We wish you well over the holidays and a very happy New Year."

        "content": "You\"re walking down the aisles of your local supermarket. You\"ve picked up lunch, but you\"ve just spotted a darling little milk jug with polka dots that will go perfectly with your cake platter. So you drop that in your basket. Then you see that it comes with a teapot and sugar bowl, so you grab those too. And then you might as well take the six matching mugs. You\"re feeling very pleased with yourself as you approach the till, so you don\"t think twice about buying a cookbook of delectable cakes now that you have a lovely set to serve high tea. Does this scenario or one with shoes and dresses, or scarves and jewellery sound familiar to you? If this is how your trips to the shops routinely turn out, then it\"s probably safe to say that you have an impulse buying problem. Some impulse spenders have the classic high-and-crash of addicts, while others truly get joy from their purchases. Whatever the manifestation of your shopaholism, taking these ten steps will set you on the road to recovery.Accept that you have to get your impulse buying under control Like the old joke about how many psychoanalysts it takes to change a light bulb (one, but the light bulb has to really want to change), you\"re not going to modify your spending problem unless you really want to. Impulse buying is like an addiction, and it can be hard to break the cycle of indulgence. The first step to moving on is switching on your willpower which is easier said than done by telling yourself, I don\"t want to do this anymore. And then make a point of sticking to it.Do a budget Every month, you should work out how much you\"ve earned, how much you need to spend and save, and how much credit you have to pay back. After you\"ve allocated all of these funds, you can spend what\"s left on random purchases. When you start to think of your spending indulgences as eating into your hard-earned surplus in monetary terms, it\"s a lot easier to get past the urge. But remember to allow for a month-end treat for sticking to your budget to keep you motivated.Cut up your credit cards This ties into the previous point, but it\"s so important that it deserves to stand alone. If you are buying food or clothes or even furniture or appliances on credit, you have your saving system backward. You should be able to afford these things from your monthly income or short-term savings for PLANNED expenses. Don\"t get into a cycle of rotating debt or paying back credit only to spend it again by the end of the month. You\"re costing yourself a fortune in interest, and you\"re just shuffling mud in and out of the debt hole. And by cutting up your credit cards and leaving one at home for emergencies, you are making it just that little bit harder to break out the plastic and spend, spend, spend!Make a list, stick to it This is possibly the simplest and most effective way to break an impulse buying habit. Before you go to the shops, or online, or near a mall for lunch, make yourself a list of what you need, and then when you get there, stick to it.Understand marketers\" tricks Remember that from the moment that you step into a mall or open a magazine or visit a website, marketers are using their tricks to get you to part with your money. By making yourself aware of the ways in which you are being manipulated, you can go some way to becoming immune to their games.For instance, don\"t be bought in by three for the price of two specials if you were only going to buy one. Make eyes front your rule, and don\"t give any tempting displays a second glance.Identify your triggers  Try to keep track of when you\"re most likely to impulse buy. Is it when you\"re sad, lonely, bored or anxious? If you identify the triggers that cause you to grab an item and head for the tills, you can learn to control your impulses or avoid the shops altogether when it\"s a bad time.If you notice a pattern that shopping is distracting you from some other emotional need or problemseek help to address the underlying issue. Talk to friends, find a support group or see a therapist.Never shop when hungry Have you ever heard the expression, your eyes are bigger than your stomach? Well, the impulse buyer\"s eye is muuuuuch bigger. If you have a food impulse buying problem, try bringing a packed lunch to work or shopping for food at 10am before the hunger pains have set in. When you do your budget, allow for the little treats that get you through the day, like a cappuccino or a pack of chewing gum, but remember to stick to your list.Deregister from all discount or group buying newsletters Who needs the temptation? Every group buying newsletter should have a deregister option. Use it. You have to let go of the mentality that you\"re going to miss out on something important. All you\"re missing out on is another opportunity to spend money on stuff you don\"t really need.If you are planning a holiday or need to buy a beauty treatment or a USB storage device, then check out these marketers\" websites (do not resubscribe), and ask for the alert that tells you when a similar deal becomes available.Ask yourself the right questions Make a mental note of these questions: Why do I want this? What will I use it for? Do I have anything else like this? Do I really need this? Is it on the list? Is it in the budget? Is it good value? If you answer these questions honestly, you will probably find that you don\"t really need that suede belt or those pink espadrilles. But it\"s very important to accept the answers that you give yourself.Implement a waiting period Most impulse buying is exactly that impulsive. If you make yourself wait half an hour (or preferably a day) for any purchases you haven\"t budgeted for, you\"ll often find that the desire has gone away.And if you do find that you\"re still desperate for whatever purchase you had your eyes on a day later, remember to check your list and your budget before making any buying decisions.Go be impulse free!  It isn\"t easy, and it isn\"t fun, but in the long run, getting your impulse buying habit under control will benefit you immensely. Remember that these ten steps will help you to spend your hard-earned money on things you really need. Good luck! "

        "content": "A treasure trove of creativity in the heart of StellenboschThousands of people flocked to the beautiful Webersburg Wine Estate in Stellenbosch last week to attend KAMERS vol Geskenke. Sponsored by 1st for Women, this annual arts and crafts event offers a platform for creative entrepreneurs to showcase and market their favourite and most recent collections. With over 165 stalls to visit, set in the picturesque Stellenbosch surrounds, this year\"s event exceeded expectations for both the organisers and the crowds who attended. With so much to do and see, KAMERS is truly a feast for the senses - each stall tells a unique story of how the vendors were able to turn a hobby into a budding business. On top of the handmade crafts, beautiful decor and compelling art exhibits, festival goers were also treated to live entertainment and a myriad food stalls to whet the appetite.As a first-time sponsor, 1st for Women was just as excited to participate and so commissioned paper artist Elizabeth Lotz from Bespoke Paperword to design and create an eye-catching paper installation for the 1st for Women stand at the event. Decorated in pink and white with hand-picked 1st for Women-branded artefacts, the stand revealed the more creative side of the 1st for Women brand. We also encouraged the public to enter our Wipe n Win competition, where entrants could win spot prizes such as umbrellas, eye masks, lipgloss and aprons and then be eligible to win three designer prizes: Bulgari sunglasses, a Le Creuset casserole set as well as a Lorenzi clutch bag. Winners were all announced on Saturday afternoon at the event.After a week of shopping and sunshine, it was finally time to pack up and prepare for the next Kamers event which takes place in Irene, Pretoria, from 2-7 December. If you weren\"t able to attend the Stellenbosch KAMERS, make sure to visit South Africa\"s treasure trove of handcrafted creativity in Gauteng. Not only will you be able to do all your Christmas shopping in one go, you might just be inspired to start your own little business on the side. See you in Irene."

        "content": "So much of a woman\"s early life is punctuated with confusion and uncertainty. We struggle to define ourselves, to relate to others in healthy ways or to identify the things that will make us truly happy. And then, at some point in our adult lives, we settle into who we really are and start to enjoy the power of our femininity.This maturity (which can happen at any age) allows us to be happy for ourselves and others and feel more settled about the life path that we have taken. Here are the six signs that you have started to find your emotional and spiritual place in the world.You\"re happy with who you areYou may never learn to love your bumpy nose, sticking out ears or thick ankles, but your least favourite bit just doesn\"t bother you anymore. It\"s a part of you, and you probably wouldn\"t change it, even if you could. Making peace with the things you can\"t change is one of life\"s great lessons, and you\"ve learnt it along the way.Of course, if there are things that you can change like unhealthy weight, a lack of fitness, or a tendency to back ache you\"ve either worked through them or at least made a good start at fixing them.You trust your intuitionIf I just don\"t know! used to be your refrain when you had to make a decision, you\"ll find that you\"re starting to move past that. A combination of feminine wisdom and life experience means that most of the time, you DO know. If something\"s a bad idea, that little voice in the back of your mind will tell you, and you\"ll listenDriving drunk (even only a little drunk)? Bad idea. The sensible, versatile shoes that cost more, but will last longer, or the cheaper, prettier, strappy ones that will look great with your blue dress? The sensible ones.

The dinner with friends, but you\"ll keep listening to your inner voice and have only one drink so you can finish the work later.You\"ve found your peopleYou\"ve surrounded yourself with people who are good for your emotional and mental health. You\"re good to them, they\"re good to you everyone wins.

        "content": "South African women have a one in 31 risk of developing breast cancer in their lifetime. During October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Cancer Association of South Africa (CANSA) urge women and female cancer survivors to encourage one another to adopt a balanced lifestyle and to go for regular screens to reduce their risk of cancer or the recurrence of cancer.The messages are simple:Women should carry out breast self examinations once a month,Women should have a clinical breast examination (observation and physical examination) by a medical professional once a year, andWomen over 40 should go for a mammogram every year.Most people know the basics of breast cancer awareness, but professionals who work in the field encounter lots of misinformation about breast cancer among their patients. We spoke to Dr Sarah Rayne, a specialist surgeon with an interest in breast diseases, to get the most important facts and common misconceptions about cancer to raise your awareness this October and to find out where you can get checked at reduced rates.Common misconceptions about breast cancer I am too young to get breast cancer. Despite all the talk about risk factors, breast cancer can happen to any woman, at any age and at any time. Because of this, if you have an abnormality or any symptom at all that you are not sure about, you should get it checked out.I can\"t get breast cancer because I have no family history. Sadly, 70% to 80% of all breast cancers happen in people with no family history. This is why it\"s so important for every woman to carry out screening and to get every symptom checked out.Breast cancer is a death sentence. Early detection really can make all the difference to your chances of surviving breast cancer. But it also makes a big difference to the type of treatment that you\"re going to get. The earlier you catch breast cancer, the less likely you are to need chemotherapy. And cancer treatment has become cleverer. Whereas treatment used to follow a prescribed plan, now tests allow doctors to analyse the personality of each cancer to determine the risk that it will come back and to work out the benefit that chemotherapy will offer.Mammograms increase your risk of breast cancer. This is not true. The radiation dose in a mammogram is extremely low about the same as the radiation exposure that you get when you are visit a shopping mall or fly to Europe.There are alternatives to mammograms for detecting cancer. No! Alternative methods like thermography or mechanised palpation do not have the sensitivity to guarantee that they will pick up cancer in time. Mammograms are the only proven method of detecting breast cancer early.Trauma to the breast can cause cancer. Fortunately, not true. Your baby biting on your nipple, an infection in your milk ducts or your toddler elbowing you in the boob will not cause cancer. Cancer is caused by cells that divide quickly and make mistakes. Trauma to your breast will not cause your cells to do this. There is sometimes a spike in the detection of cancer after trauma to the breast because of the area is examined more frequently.Stress causes cancer. There is no direct relationship between stress and cancer. But it is important to beware of the unhealthy practices that we engage in when we are stressed. Smoking, drinking more (more than two small glasses a day) and exercising less (exercise decreases your breast cancer risk by 42%) all increase your risk of developing cancer.A helping hand The best thing to do to take care of your own breast health is to be informed and to examine your breasts every month for changes or lumps, says Dr Sarah. Women who examine their own breasts regularly pick up lumps earlier.And remember that while Breast cancer is one of the leading diseases affecting women, but it is by no means the only disease. While you are focusing on checking yourself every year for breast cancer, don\"t forget to do a PAP smear and to check your blood pressure and HIV status. There\"s no point in winning one battle but losing the war.If you are concerned about breast cancer, or have any questions, you can get in touch with Dr Sarah by visiting the Netcare Breast Care Unit website and clicking on the button to Ask Dr Sarah.Breast Cancer Awareness Month: Get examined One of the reasons that women avoid medical breast examination is concern about costs. Fortunately, there are some affordable options to get yourself checked out some during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and some all year around:The Radiology Society of South Africa is offering reduced-fee mammograms during October.CANSA Care Centres and Mobile Health Clinics will perform free screening or assess any concerning signs or symptoms. Click on the link to find the location of a clinic or the route of the mobile units.Government hospitals will perform clinical examinations on request for free or for a minimal government healthcare charge.Some centres, such as the Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg have a free screening programme. Dr Sarah sees new patients at this hospital on Wednesday mornings for free or minimal government charge and with no referral or appointment. You can email her on helenjoseph.breastcare@gmail.com."

        "description": "",
        "content": "That\"s right, you heard it hear first! According to The SME Survey 2014, an annual study of factors behind the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa, a small business owned by a women has a better chance of being profitable than one run by a man.The survey also surprisingly found that companies owned by couples or a mix of genders are substantially less likely to be profitable than those operated by either male or female owners.The research signifies that of the male-owned SMEs, 20% are strongly profitable and 49% are just\" profitable. Of the jointly owned SMEs, 16% are strongly profitable while 37% are just\" profitable. When it comes to the female-owned SMEs, 15% are strongly profitable and 63% just\" profitable.This equates to 78% of women-owned businesses being profitable, ahead of the 70% for men. You go girls!Although this signifies great success for women, the level of female ownership is exceptionally low - just 8% of South African SMEs are female-owned businesses. This massive gender imbalance in entrepreneurship tells us that women are not given enough encouragement or support to become entrepreneurs.1st for Women believes that more must be done to close this gender gap but the problem has to be addressed at a systemic level, starting at school and extending through the workforce to give women not only the skills, but the confidence to start their own businesses - as it has been proven now undoubtedly that this is something women can be very successful at.In 2007, 1st for Women Insurance launched a business insurance offering specially aimed at female SMEs. This insurance product covers 24 different types of SMEs in South Africa. Each package is tailor-made to suit the needs of businesswomen and business owners.For more information on our tailor-made business insurance offering, click here."

        "content": "After you\"ve unpacked the boxes and hung the curtains, you may still find yourself feeling a little displaced in your new home. Most people don\"t really feel that they belong until they\"ve been in a new neighbourhood for a year, seen their favourite tree in blossom, had some level of social interaction with the neighbours and worked out all their favourite local shops and restaurants.While all of these naturally take time and trees only blossom in spring there are lots of things that you can do to speed up the process of settling in to your new community.Get the utilities in your name and change your bank branch and post officeAfter buying a house, you probably never want to deal with paperwork again. Sadly, it\"s not over. Dedicate a day to sorting out all your utilities, the telephone and your rates, so that everyone who wants money from you knows where to find you and you get to enjoy their continued service. And move your bank branch and PO box address close to home to stop you from driving across town every time you have to do a bit of admin.Make your new home secureIdentify a security company with a strong local presence and ask your neighbours for their recommendation. Find out from the security company how many cars they keep in your area and what their guaranteed response time is. Many security companies offer a free evaluation and alarm system on sign-up, so look out for those kinds of specials to save you money. But watch out for contracts that tie you in to their service for longer than two years. If they don\"t offer you an evaluation, carry one out yourself by walking around your property and looking for any weaknesses. Make patching them up a priority. Update your insuranceYou may already have household insurance and car insurance, but it can be invalid if you don\"t update your residential address. Your insurance provider will take into account things like whether you have burglar bars and an electric fence and where your car is parked at night to adjust your premiums, so be sure you\"re covered for your new home.Introduce yourself to the neighboursIf you\"re lucky, your neighbours will have taken care of this by coming around with a tray of scones or a glass of wine when you were moving in. If not, don\"t worry about it people are busy and lives are increasingly insular. Pop in at a reasonable hour just after work is a good time to introduce yourself and exchange phone numbers.Join the residents association or body corporateNot every neighbourhood or apartment complex has a team of busybodies to make people feel welcome and boss them around, but if yours does, get involved immediately. These types of organisation are extremely useful for keeping you posted on things that are happening in your area, for security and for creating a sense of community. Sign up for their newsletter if they have one.Find your local shops, restaurants and medical professionalsGive everything that\"s closest to you a try. Make a weekly date night at one of the restaurants on your nearest main road or in your nearest mall to work out which one\"s your favourite. Invite your friends over to try out your new hood. If you\"re not loyal to your doctor and dentist elsewhere, find a recommendation for someone local so that a trip to the GP doesn\"t mean a trek across town. Find out the best route to your nearest emergency room.Go for a walkSouth Africans live such harried lives, driving from one destination to another and always in a rush. Set aside a morning or an afternoon to take a slow walk around your neighbourhood. If you\"re up for venturing a little further afield, walk to your local shops for the Sunday papers or a cup of coffee, and make a point of appreciating your surroundings. And if you\"re a runner, do all of this, only faster.Give yourself timeWhile some people feel right at home, right away, others feel a sense of loss or loneliness in a new place even if it\"s their dream home. Remember that moving is one of the three most stressful experiences that human beings routinely go through, so go easy on yourself. With time, you\"ll feel right at home."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Some women (and men) will take expensive measures to look their best, from waxing to electrolysis to Botox and fillers. While being pulled and prodded in the pursuit of beauty might be something we have learnt to grin and bear, sometimes the discomfort should sound alarm bells.In fact, many common beauty treatments are harmful to your health especially those that offer lasting change. It\"s never worth doing yourself damage while trying to look good, so we\"ve listed the leading harmful beauty treatments so that you know which ones to steer clear of.Scorching sun bedsJust because they\"re not the sun doesn\"t mean that they\"re not harming your skin. The process of burning your skin until it turns brown is harmful whether you\"re doing it naturally or on a sun bed. Both tans are the result of UV rays that can cause skin cancer. And, in the long-term, exposure to these rays in the sun or on sun beds will leave your skin leathery and wrinkled.The solution: Accept that social conditioning has led you to believe that tans are healthy. Try to think of undamaged skin as beautiful instead. If that doesn\"t work for you, acknowledge the risks associated with damaging your skin and opt for a fake tanning product instead. Painful peelsChemical peels can provide an almost magical improvement to the surface of your skin and there\"s no harm in that if they are applied infrequently by a professional beautician or dermatologist. However, using home kits and performing chemical peels more often than once a month can lead to thinning, damaged, pigmented skin. Chemical peels work by stripping away the top layer of dead cells, which sounds like a good thing, but this layer is actually your first barrier against pollutants and infection. Stripping it away too often can cause permanent damage to the skin beneath.The solution: Have occasional peels under the guidance of a professional skin care practitioner. The rest of the time, a daily combination of cleanser, toner and moisturiser, with a weekly exfoliation should keep your skin glowing.Be wary of whiteningWho doesn\"t want a mouth full of glowing pearly whites? But the pursuit of the perfect smile can often lead to sensitivity and damage to your teeth and gums. Peroxide is the most common teeth-whitening agent and it is a corrosive substance. Applying it in too high a concentration or too frequently can damage your enamel and inflame your gums.The solution: Again, it\"s a good idea to only have your teeth whitened under the supervision of a dental professional. Good dental hygiene and cutting back on dark beverages will also prevent teeth stains in the first place.Brazilian blow-driesThese days women are clamouring for straightening products that leave them with permanent needle straight locks. But the active ingredient in the Brazilian Blow Outs that have taken the world by storm is formaldehyde a toxic and volatile substance that can be extremely harmful to human health. Germany, France and Ireland have set the maximum percentage at which it can be used in beauty treatments at 0,2%, but studies have shown that many manufacturers flout these regulations. Generally speaking, it\"s best to avoid products containing any of this chemical at all. There are a number of these straightening products out there opt for one of these.The solution: Although it\"s not particularly good for your hair, daily blow-drying is far less detrimental to your overall health. Or speak to your hairdresser about styles and products that enhance more of your hair\"s natural bounce and life.Nasty nail treatmentsWe suspect you\"re not going to be happy with this one. Gel manicures, which promise the durability of false nails but are painted on to your actual nails, are hardened into place using an unregulated UV light. If you remember the first point about sun beds, you\"ll understand why this is a bad thing. Essentially, you\"re increasing your risk of skin cancer and while you might have stunning nails that last for weeks your hands will grow brown and aged in the years to come. The gel manicure also needs to be removed by soaking your hands in an acetone bath, which causes your nails to thin and your skin to dry out. The solution: Go back to the old polish-and-wave-your-hands-until-they\"re-dry approach. Also, give your nails a break from any kind of treatment at all from time to time to give them the chance to breathe.Too good to be trueIf you feel that you can\"t give up any of these beauty routines, remember that you are opening yourself up to long-term health complications. It\"s important to remember that true beauty comes from within, so hurting your body to achieve a lasting but superficial improvement is a kind of madness. Rather stick to natural and gentle beauty products and processes and leave the science in the laboratories."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Christmas comes once a year, but the hole that it leaves in your bank account is the gift that keeps on taking for the next 12 months. Even though last year was economically turbulent, the Deloitte Year-End Holiday Survey 2013 reported that people still spent 8.95% more on socialising; 7.18% more on gifts and 3.7% more on food than the previous holiday season. There\"s no reason to suspect 2014 will buck this trend.To avoid a December holiday budget blow-out, start planning in advance around now. Here are our top six holiday-savings tips to keep you on a debt detox\" to avoid a Christmas cash crunch.Save in advanceEven if you know you\"re going to get a bonus, start saving now for unforeseen holiday expenses. If you\"re going to take leave, your days are going to be filled with spending opportunities, never mind the costs of holiday food, accommodation and, if you celebrate Christmas, festivities and presents. Putting aside a portion of your monthly earnings is a good idea all year around, but even more so as the December holidays draw closer.Spend in advanceIf there are things that you can pay for now, then snap them up faster than you can say plan ahead. For instance, if you\"ve booked holiday accommodation, pay the total now rather than waiting until the holidays, when you will want to spend your money on other things. Buy Christmas presents and holiday essentials like sunblock, towels, hats and swimming costumes (or ski jackets and snow socks) now rather than the week before you leave. Set a budgetSit down with your loved ones and take a long hard look at holiday expenses, write them down and total them up. Include accommodation, travel, daily food allowance, gifts and entertainment as well as all your usual monthly expenses like bills and insurance. Seeing a final figure can be a stark wake-up for many holidaymakers. Use that to set your daily budget and, when the time comes, don\"t spend it all in one go.Treat yourself but try not to overindulgeThere\"s a heady freedom to the December holidays, and may people feel that part of that liberation should be not worrying about money. But irresponsible spending is actually only delaying the worry until the new year. People often plunge themselves into debt over the December holidays and then spend the rest of the year playing catch-up. Remember that budget you made? Stick to it. You will thank us when you\"re enjoying financial freedom for the rest of the year.Bank your bonusIf you\"re fortunate enough to be the recipient of a 13th cheque or bonus, it\"s easy to see that as free money. After a long year you deserve a little holiday splurge, but set aside some of the money to pay off debt: put some money into your bond, pay back a loan or clear your credit card.Remember January?Many South Africans receive their December pay cheque on the 16th of the month before everyone in the accounts department goes on holiday. This means that, bonus notwithstanding, your December salary has to last two weeks longer than any other monthly income. There are four weeks after New Year that you still have to cover, so don\"t go overboard while you\"re on leave.The things that really matterThis list may make you feel restricted at a time when you want to enjoy yourself the most, but remember that life\"s real pleasures are relaxation, time spent with loved ones and the beauty of nature, all of which cost you nothing. Try to move away from consumerist festivities and appreciate the real things in life."

        "content": "For the past two years, hail storms have left a catastrophic trail of destruction, desolating thousands upon thousands of cars and homes. This year, we are urging our policyholders to be prepared as hail season is right around the corner!South Africa\"s summer rains usually start in October and last until March or April. They are characterised by late afternoon thunderstorms that often involve lightning and hail. That said, hail storms are often unpredictable and while the South African Weather Service can predict a large storm two days before it hits, radar can only pick up hail stones in the clouds 30 minutes or so before they drop to earth.In an effort to keep you and you possessions safe and sound, here are a few tips on what to do when the hail hits:To reduce your risk of being caught in a storm, take heed of 1st for Women\"s SMS weather alert service which forewarns policyholders of adverse weather conditions. This SMS service is free and automatically available to all 1st for Women policyholders.Proctect your carWhen hail is forecasted, try to make arrangements to park your car undercover and delay travelling until the storm has subsided.If you are caught in a hail storm, look for cover. This could include a covered car park, a petrol station or under a bridge. However, take extreme care when pulling-over, put on your hazard lights, and don\"t risk your safety or the safety of others by dashing madly for cover.Don\"t park under trees as there is a danger of falling branches and debris. Stay in your car and only leave the safety of your sheltered spot when the storm has passed.If there is no shelter nearby, motorists are urged to pull-over onto the side of the road if it is safe to do so. In an unsheltered spot, hail damage is inevitable but, it is safer not to drive through a storm when visibility is poor, the roads are slick and there is a risk of aquaplaning through deep pools of water and hail.Another idea is to keep heavy blankets in your car. This will provide you with a protective covering you can throw over the bonnet of your car to prevent hail damage.Protect your houseAt home, steps can be taken to mimimise damage to property. Gutters should be kept clean and free of debris to channel ice and water away from the roof.Outdoor equipment and furniture should be moved undercover if possible when a heavy storm is forecasted.Hail FAQsDo I have to submit my claim immediately?

        "description": "",
        "content": "Spring is all about new beginnings and starting over. It\"s the perfect opportunity to take control of your own happiness by introducing activities into your life that make you feel better about yourself. To celebrate the new season we\"ve listed eight ways for you to pull yourself out of your winter slump. If you make these a regular part of your life, by the time next autumn rolls around, no amount of bad weather will be able to put the freeze on your good mood.1. Find an exercise routine that you loveThe benefits of exercise go far beyond simply keeping fit and healthy. The endorphins released when you work out give you a natural high and the long-term psychological benefits of doing the best thing that you possibly can for your body are immense.However, there\"s no point in slogging through an exercise routine that you hate. Try to find something that appeals to you a dance class, swimming, yoga, running or weights it doesn\"t really matter as long as you get your heart rate up and do it regularly.2. Keep calm and breatheDeep breathing releases toxins and invigorates the mind and body, but our hurried modern lifestyles mean that you often forget to breathe properly. You may spend your days hunched over a computer, slouching in your car in traffic, or just rushing around taking quick shallow breaths because you\"re always in a state of slight panic. The best way to fill your body with life-giving oxygen which fights disease and energises the body and mind is to take deep diaphragmatic breaths into your belly. Try to remember to adjust your breathing throughout the day especially when you\"re feeling stressed or panicked and you will notice a world of difference. 3. Avoid the short-term fix of caffeineThere are a lot of good reasons to avoid stimulants. Although you may feel like your body needs your morning cup of coffee, that need is in fact a sign of addiction. Unless you keep feeding that addiction, you\"ll end up anxious, jittery, tired and tense. But if you keep drinking that coffee, it increases the stress hormones and insulin levels in your body, it harms your essential gut flora and it makes it difficult to rely on your body\"s natural energy reserves.We\"re not suggesting you ban the beans entirely, but be aware that this daily treat is actually doing far more harm than good especially if you\"ve tipped over the one or two cups a day mark.4. Get enough sleepIf you are cramming more hours into your day by sleeping less, you aren\"t doing yourself any favours. Being short on sleep can make you emotional and irritable, and slow your reflexes and your thinking. In the long term, people who don\"t sleep enough are at greater risk of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, headaches and depression. The bottom line is that you need to prioritise sleep schedule your eight hours of shut-eye just like you plan for everything else that you do.5. Eat the right foodsWhenever women talk about foods that cheer them up, chocolate is top of the list. That\"s all well and good for a treat, but the foods that really give you energy and boost your mood are usually far simpler. Try a piece of fruit and some cottage cheese or almonds, a bowl of berries and Greek yoghurt or a salad crammed full of nuts, feta and cucumber.If you know that you have bad food habits like too much sugar or junk food make a resolution to save your indulgence for Sundays only. Your greatest weapon against poor nutrition is planning ahead, so fill your fridge and pantry with heart-healthy, sugar-free, low-carb snacks and don\"t be at the mercy of the office vending machine.6. Make time to meditateIf your first response to this point was, Who has time to meditate? then that\"s saying something right there. For some people, meditation is about getting in touch with a deeper spirituality, for others it\"s simply about taking the time to try to clear their heads and slow down. Either way, it is hugely beneficial for your state of mind and your stress levels.You don\"t need to do a transcendental meditation course to get started - just look up a practice on the internet, or light a candle, take a few deep breaths and try to clear your mind or focus on a mantra that\"s relevant to you.7. Fill your life with positive peopleEveryone has friends and family members who are a drain on their emotional resources, and others who radiate positive energy. Try to spend more time with the people who add value with positive contributions like moral support or good (wanted) advice.A good rule of thumb is that if you come away from an encounter with a friend feeling positive and happy, then those are the friendships you should nurture. And quietly distance yourself from the ones that leave you feeling sad or depleted.8. Spring-clean your home and your mindIt\"s not called spring-cleaning for nothing. When there\"s new life and warm weather, it just gets so much easier to get to all the little tasks you\"ve been putting off all winter. And cleaning out your physical space has massive benefits for your head space as well.At the same time, you could go through a mental spring-clean. That fight you had with a close friend? Make amends and move on. That promotion you didn\"t get at work? Let go of the resentment and plan how to get ahead the next time. That thing your partner said and you aren\"t sure what he meant? Discuss it when you are both relaxed and in a good mood. Let go of any negative obsessive thoughts, and try to look to the future with positivity.Another way to de-clutter your brain is to identify problem areas in your life and set yourself goals for dealing with them. That way, when you start to worry about a problem, you will have a deadline for dealing with it.Keep at it!While keeping happy can seem like a lot of hard work, most of these steps become second nature if you just make them a regular part of your routine. Get through the summer breathing deeply, meditating, exercising and eating right, and you will greet every season with a spring in your step."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Last year in South Africa, it was reported that the crime rate for sexual offences was 127 per 100 000 people. This means that roughly 67 300 sexual offence cases were opened with the police. And it is generally accepted that only one in nine (or fewer) survivors of sexual violence report it to the police, meaning that at least 605 700 sexual offences took place last year.These are terrifying statistics. With numbers like these, there is an extremely good chance that you or someone you know will be a victim of sexual violence at some point in your life. But very few people know what to do in the wake of such a horrific and traumatic experience, when the actions that they take are crucial to the successful prosecution of the perpetrator.We spoke to Michelle Solomon, the media liaison of the Silent Protest in Grahamstown, to find out what women should do at such a difficult time.In the immediate aftermath of a rape, it\"s important to ensure that the victim is in a safe space with supportive friends or family, she says. The circle of supportive people should try to convince, but not coerce or force, the victim to go to hospital and undergo a medical exam as well as a rape exam.How to preserve the evidenceWhile the victim will of course be severely traumatised and may not want to report the rape, it\"s possible that she may change her mind later, so the same steps and care should be taken to preserve the evidence. The victim must not:Wash any part of her body including her hands because the blood and skin of her attacker might be under her fingernails.Use the toilet.Drink anything or brush her teeth.Brush her hair again, pieces of evidence may have gathered there.Change her clothes.Clean or disturb anything in the area where the rape took place.If the rape victim doesn\"t have any choice but to change her clothes, or has other evidence she believes may be relevant to her case, each item of clothing must be placed in a separate paper bag or envelope. Michelle explains that plastic degrades evidence, so placing clothes in a plastic bag could mean that the evidence becomes useless.Where to go for a rape examinationIt is better to go directly to a hospital than to the police, as that is where rape kits are held and rape examinations are performed. If possible, try to get to a Netcare hospital, as they have 37 Sexual Assault Centres around the country, where they offer free counselling to men, women and children immediately after rape and for a year after.A family doctor can do the rape exam at the hospital, as the instructions in the kit are easy to follow by medical personnel. A friend can stay in the room with the victim, and if the victim is a minor, it is crucial that a parent or guardian is present.Reporting rape to the policeReporting a rape is a personal choice and the victim\"s decision must be respected. If she wants to report it, it is best to give a statement to the police as soon as she is able, but this can be postponed if she is too traumatised. The police should come to take a statement from her at the hospital. However, if there is a delay in reporting the rape, the victim will then have to go to a police station. If a rape victim does go to a police station before going to hospital, it should be one that has its own Thuthuzela Care Centre, which is a world-renowned model for best practice in assisting rape victims. She will then be transported from the police station to a hospital in an ambulance in the company of specialised, trained volunteers or medical personnel.Contraceptive and antiretroviral careMichelle explains that the 2007 Sexual Offences Act requires that rape survivors be given a 28-day course of antiretrovirals for the prevention of HIV infection. These must be provided at the state\"s expense when a survivor reports to a healthcare facility within 72 hours of the assault. This medication is less effective if it is administered after 48 hours and completely ineffective after 72 hours.Rape victims are also entitled to emergency contraceptives usually in the form of the morning-after pill. By law, no hospital may deny a victim access to these services. However, rape survivors are often denied information or access to this drug by the police, so it is very important to know your rights.Long-term supportAfter going through the overwhelmingly traumatic experience of a rape, the victim should find a way to get ongoing psychological support. Michelle recommends that they contact the Stop Gender Violence Helpline, which is a division of Lifeline with counsellors trained to help survivors of gender-based violence. Their number is 0800 150 150.If you are the friend of a rape victim, it is your role to be compassionate and supportive. Michelle explains that blaming, shaming or interrogating a rape survivor are not only deeply unethical but also incredibly cruel. The most important thing is that a survivor feels supported and safe with the people that she loves and relies on.Final wordNothing can undo the physical or psychological trauma of rape, but with the correct care and support for the victim, the prosecutor can be brought to justice and the victim can find some kind of closure."

        "content": "Back in the day when I was a student and taking every Gender Politics course my liberal university could dream up, I got the notion in my head that it wasn\"t so great being a girl; that the world was kind of against us and life would be tough and I\"d have to really fight to get ahead and be happy. And while I have nothing but respect for my strong, female lecturers who taught me some really important things about the world I was entering (and I have certainly met my share of chauvinistic men), 20 years on I don\"t agree with them anymore. I think it\"s really fabulous being a woman, and here\"s why:1. We have more choices than menIn theory, men can choose not to pursue careers and stay at home raising the kids. In reality, not so much. Except for a handful of countries in northern Europe where it\"s normal(ish) for the dad to be the one hosting coffee mornings, in most places it\"s considered deeply odd for the male in the relationship not to be the breadwinner or at least bring in half the dosh. So, men are kind of stuffed. While for a number of us we women can decide whether we want to work out of the house or not, and nobody judges us either way. And that\"s pretty cool if you think about it.2. We don\"t have to know how to fix thingsI consider myself a fairly hardcore feminist (call me a lady\" and I snarl), but give me a wonky toilet cistern (or a faulty lock or a leaky pool pump) and I turn into Scarlett O\" Hara with ringlets and ribbons, unable to do anything but wave worriedly in the direction of the broken thing until someone else (usually the man I\"m married to) fetches a wrench and makes it all better.3. We\"re allowed to cry Imagine growing up being told it\"s not okay to show how you feel. That must be really rubbish. I think society has done men a great injustice, and I\"m happy it\"s slowly changing. Let\"s raise our male children to be okay with being sad, because sometimes a good cry is all you need.4. We make human beingsWith the tiniest amount of help, we women actually grow people. Now if that isn\"t some serious power, I don\"t know what is.5. We get away with stuff While my Gender Politics lecturers will be wondering how they got it so wrong with me, the truth of the matter is that we\"re much less likely to get beaten up in bars for being obnoxious; get given speeding fines if we\"re contrite, and more likely to win arguments if we cry a little. We are also the first to be allowed off sinking ships. For the most part, men are expected to tolerate any moodiness and/or irrational behaviour, illogicality and being helpless when it suits us. So, let\"s celebrate the fact that we actually lucked out big time. Just don\"t tell the boys. Happy Women\"s Day, all!Susan Hayden is an acclaimed South African writer and blogger. Her articles have appeared in Cosmopolitan, Shape, Oprah, Women\"s Health, Marie Claire and the Sunday Times. She is also the author of a blog called The Disco Pants Blog"

        "content": "You always believed that it is important to take your vitamins. They make your skin glow, your hair shine and your nails strong. Oh, and you won\"t get flu in winter. Yes, vitamins are basically all that\"s knitting your body together.But then, articles started appearing in the news about how vitamins and supplements don\"t really do anything for you at all. So what is a girl to do? Trash all of your shiny bottles of vitamins? Were they really doing you no good at all? It can\"t be true.Unfortunately, it is, says Johannesburg general practitioner Isabel Thompson. Your body gets the nutrients it needs from the food that you eat even if your diet isn\"t particularly healthy. And Vitamin C does not prevent or treat the common cold.She explains that vitamin supplements are mostly just expensive placebos that you don\"t really need. It\"s easy to believe that with your busy life, you aren\"t eating a proper diet and vitamins are the solution. However, an unbalanced diet is usually high in protein, refined carbohydrates and bad fats, and Dr Thompson points out that vitamins won\"t undo the damage you are doing to your health with these foods. . She advises that fresh, home-cooked meals made up of lots of vegetables are the best way to get all the nutrients you need.Even so, there are some vitamins or supplements that doctors do prescribe to treat particular ailments. Dr Thompson says that it is only really useful to take these if you actually have the condition and the results are being monitored by your doctor.These include:Omega 3 oils for high cholesterol If you have high cholesterol, you should be under the care of a doctor. Omega 3 oils may have some benefits in helping to reduce bad cholesterol (the jury is out), and regular testing will let you know if this is working.Calcium for bone densityIf you have any of the early signs of osteoporosis or a family history of the disease, a doctor may recommend a calcium supplement. In all likelihood, this should only be a concern when you are in your forties. Taking a calcium supplement for your entire adult life will not prevent osteoporosisIron for anaemia If you are weak, pale and short of breath, your doctor may test your iron levels. If you have an iron deficiency, you will be prescribed an iron supplement. There is no point in taking iron if you don\"t have anaemia, because it can be hard on your liver. Women can also suffer from vitamin B anaemia and folic acid anaemia. The appropriate supplement will be prescribed by a doctor and its effects should be tested.While trashing your supplements may provide great relief to your bank balance, many women feel that their daily doses of vitamins and minerals really do make a difference in their lives. And that, says Dr Thompson, is perfectly fine. If you feel that they make your eyes brighter and give you a spring in your step, then there\"s no harm in taking them, just remember to drink lots of water not tea or coffee or juice to wash them down."

        "content": "We all tell ourselves little white lies from time to time, and that\"s OK. But when those lies keep us stuck in a rut or start to justify poor decisions the process of self-delusion can become destructive.We have taken a look at the top six lies that women tell themselves about their bodies, their health and their states of mind, and given you a way to replace them with a positive, empowering truth.I\"ll start tomorrow.We generally know what we should be doing to improve our lives, our health and our moods, but taking the first step is almost impossible. Whether it\"s starting an exercise programme, diet or social activity, we sustain ourselves with the promise that we will tackle it tomorrow but tomorrow never comes.The truth: Start today. Right now. Walk around the block, eat a healthy dinner or call your friend you haven\"t spoken to in a while. And then keep doing it.I\"m ugly because of my awful thighs/nose/belly/ankles.Look, we\"re not in a position to make an objective assessment of the various parts of your body but nobody\"s perfect. You may not have the world\"s slimmest thighs, but you might have the most dazzling smile. The most appealing characteristic, however, is confidence, so try not to obsess about the bits of you that you like the least.The truth: Life isn\"t about tallying up physical attributes to see who comes out ahead (although it can sometimes feel like that). Work on accentuating what you do have but, more importantly, remember that it\"s the person on the inside that makes friends and wins hearts.I deserve this treat/purchase/breakSheryl Crow sang, If it makes you happy, it can\"t be that bad, so it must be true. Um, actually no. There are countless things in life that deliver instant gratification but do nothing for you in the long termThe truth: You know what\"s good for you and what\"s not. If you need a treat, go right ahead, but don\"t allow short-term happiness to justify ongoing overindulgence in unhealthy choices. One way to set up a good work/reward system is to plan your rewards at the outset. So, for instance, you can have a calorie-laden dessert if you stick to your diet for a whole week. Or you can stop and read a chapter of your book once you\"ve finished four pages of your assignment. And don\"t let yourself slip up before the allocated milestone.I can afford this.How easily we fall into the trap of the impulse buy. Our consumerist culture is set up to make us believe that we must have whatever we want, right away. We have to spend to save. We have to buy one to get one free. Or, really, we just deserve it. This kind of culture makes us neglect our budgets and ignore our bank balancesThe truth: You should never buy clothes or food on credit. Every month, you should cover all your expenses. Then you should allocate a portion of your income to long-term savings such as your retirement, medium-term savings such as a house or a car, and short-term savings for things like holidays, electronic goods or designer clothes. Your monthly surplus can then be spent on impulse purchases.I thrive on stress.Stress is one of the greatest killers of the modern age, leading to hypertension and metabolic diseases as well as countless other emotional and physical complaints. But, for many of us, it\"s such a normal, sustained state of being that we don\"t know how we\"d exist without it.The truth: You need downtime even if at first you don\"t know what to do with yourself. If you find yourself suffocating under pressure and deadlines and demands, plan a way out from under the heap. Book yourself a holiday somewhere where you can stare at a river or a mountain, enjoy your surroundings and breathe.Being with him is better than being alone.Some of us are so desperate to be in a relationship that we overlook any negative aspect of a partner\"s personality to justify keeping him around. Possessiveness, laziness, selfishness, a lack of ambition, financial irresponsibility or not being committed are all ignored as we try to convince ourselves that he\"s a decent guy deep down.The truth: While everyone isn\"t perfect, there are some characteristics that can make a man a less-than-ideal mate. Listen to the nagging voice of uncertainty in your mind and be honest with yourself. If he isn\"t worth the emotional investment, let him go. It\"s better to be alone and moving forward than held back by someone who doesn\"t support you in your life and growth.The final truthEverybody is made up of good and bad characteristics, and it\"s the combination of both that make you uniquely you. Focus on showing your positives to the rest of the world, but remember that your negatives also make you interesting. So don\"t beat up on yourself, but don\"t cut yourself too much slack either. Self-improvement is a lifelong journey; enjoy the ride."

        "description": "",
        "content": "You are single. Your friends aren\"t. You\"d like to meet a guy, but all the good men have been snapped up by your friends, and all that\"s left are the weird ones. You have heard that internet dating has become the de rigueur way for people to hook up, but you are also terrified of being plagued by freaks or worse, not getting any responses at all.Internet dating has taken off as the way for couples to find each other in today\"s increasingly digitised world. But as with most things in life, what you put in is what you get out. With that in mind, here is a list of the essential ingredients for a successful online dating experience.A great photoIf you look at online dating sites, the profiles that you notice are the ones with photos. Don\"t be coy or shy if you are putting yourself out there, do it properly. The best photos are ones with a smile (not a disdainful duck face) that looks natural rather than posed. But even if you are a fun-lovin\" outdoors kind of girl, don\"t post the picture of you with a sweaty forehead in a climbing harness. Also, don\"t show too much flesh, because you could well end up attracting exactly the type of interest you would like to avoid. Get a friend to take some photos and ask a few friends which they think are the best ones.Fill in the whole profilePut all your information out there. Nice guys who are serious about online dating are going to read your profile carefully to look for things that you have in common. If you aren\"t giving them information to go on, then you are asking to be contacted by random guys looking for a quick fling.General is better than specificAlthough you should share a lot of personal information, don\"t make it too specific. For instance, it\"s better to say that you enjoy romantic comedies than to say, I absolutely loved The Notebook\". If your potential date hated The Notebook\", he might move on, but he wouldn\"t have as much of a problem with the broader category and one movie does not a marriage make.Think carefully about what you say While it\"s important to be honest, it\"s also always a good idea to look at how information will be perceived to people who don\"t know you. For instance, if you are a vegetarian for health reasons but could happily date a meat eater, be aware that saying you don\"t eat meat will trigger certain warning bells. If you support a rugby team, but don\"t absolutely have to be at the pub for every match, don\"t say that you are an avid Sharks supporter.Work out what you want in a guy Have a long, hard think about what\"s important to you. Write down the relevant criteria in deal breakers, essentials and nice to have columns. This is important when you are checking your responses don\"t be distracted by one great characteristic (and a nice photo), when you know that you couldn\"t possibly date someone from a different religion or who doesn\"t want kids.Filter your responsesIf some guy writes to you to say that he thinks you\"re hot and he would like to hook up, chances are that he\"s not responding to something in your profile. Politely decline all messages that seem to want casual hook-ups and put your energy into pursuing those that are looking for a meaningful connection (if that\"s what you want).Meeting upThe trick to meeting up is to go for coffee, not dinner. That way, if you are having a dreadful time, it\"s easy to extricate yourself after one round. And if you are having a great time, you can extend the date into a meal or movie. But remember, it\"s always a good idea to let a friend know where you are going and who you are going to be with.Dating in the real worldOnce you have graduated from cyberspace into the real world, you can proceed exactly as you would with any other date meet each other\"s friends, meet each other\"s parents, and all the other steps until happily ever after!"

        "content": "When power was cheap and environmental concerns weren\"t so pressing, it was easy to feel entitled to use as much electricity as we wanted. Now that things are different, we all have to adjust our mindsets. If you start to view electricity as a precious resource, you\"ll be surprised at how much you can save.As our electricity costs are spiralling out of control and the threat of load-shedding is ever present, here are some clever tricks to keep your electricity bill under control and help ease the burden on Eskom\"s grid to see you through winter.Tackle your geyserMost people only bath or shower in the mornings and evenings, so running a geyser for the rest of the day is wasteful. Get a geyser blanket to conserve the heat that\"s been generated, and install a timer that switches your geyser on about two hours before you\"re likely to need it. You\"ll notice an instant change in your electricity bill.You can also install an efficient showerhead that reduces the amount of water that you use so that, essentially, you\"re heating less water. Insulate your homeWe\"re lucky that we don\"t have to tape up our windows in winter like they do in Canada, but there\"s still a lot to be gained by insulating your home. Most of your home\"s heat is lost through the roof, simply because heat rises. If you install an insulation layer above your ceiling, you\"ll notice a definite change in the ambient household temperature, and heated rooms will stay warmer for longer. Look online for environmentally friendly insulation solutions. Use gas for heating  Of course, gas still costs money, but gas heaters are very efficient and can warm a whole room in a short time, after which you can turn them down or off. The costs are also easier to control than those of electric heaters. Just be sure that you always have an extra gas canister handy, because there\"s nothing worse than hearing that final splutter when the shops are closed.Save on your cuppa Hot tea and coffee are your lifeblood in the winter months, but boiling kettles guzzle electricity. Remember to only ever heat as much water as you need (measure it if you\"re making one cup of tea, boil one cup of water). And, if you have municipal gas, you can boil a kettle on your stove top.   Buy a hot water bottleAs long as your hands, lap or tummy are warm, the rest of your body doesn\"t feel so cold. Use a hot water bottle (or microwaveable bean bag) as a mobile warmth pouch to keep you feeling cozy one body part at a time. These are particularly useful for slipping between the sheets so you don\"t have to face the icy chill of cold linen at bed time.Save on your cuppa Hot tea and coffee are your lifeblood in the winter months, but boiling kettles guzzle electricity. Remember to only ever heat as much water as you need (measure it if you\"re making one cup of tea, boil one cup of water). And, if you have municipal gas, you can boil a kettle on your stove top. Install panel heatersEnergy-saving wall heaters are a cost-effective solution if you have a small space that you want to keep cozy, like a baby\"s room or your lounge. The trick is that you turn them on long before you need them, and their low-voltage heating keeps the room warm, relatively cheaply. Make load-shedding work for youWhatever tricks you may have up your sleeve for reducing your power usage, Eskom often plays a winning hand and plunges you into cold, silent darkness. While it\"s not possible to learn to love load shedding, you can make the most of it. Have a black-out kit\" tucked away and stock it with necessities and luxuries to get you through the darkness/chilly interlude. Fill it with candles, a lighter, those camping hand and toe warmers, a bottle of your finest whiskey or wine, a slab of chocolate and a packet of nuts or biltong. If you don\"t have a gas oven in your kitchen, it\"s a good idea to buy a little camping stove so that you can still heat up soup or tea. Then, on colder nights, when the power goes down, crack open your kit and play a board game or snuggle up with your loved ones by candlelight."

        "content": "You have seen the signs as you drive your car into the parking garage at your local mall: Car-jamming is a reality. Make sure your car is locked.Unfortunately, car-jamming has become a hard and fast reality in South Africa, with convicted car-jammers informing the police that they can earn up to R15 000 a week. How can you make sure that you\"re not another victim?Counter car-jamming Car-jamming is the use of a remote control unit to override the locking function of your remote control as you leave your car. As a result, you unknowingly walk away leaving your car unlocked and your alarm off. When you come back, all your valuable possessions have been stolen from your car or the car itself has been stolen. On the upside, car-jamming is easy to thwart - you simply have to be attentive. When you press your remote control button, make sure that you hear the beep of your alarm activating and see or hear the locks clicking into place. The police even advise that you check your door handle before leaving the car. The extra seconds of inconvenience could save you hours of admin, thousands of rands and loads of heartache.General safety tips Car-jamming isn\"t the only risk to your parked car. Here are some other tips to keep your car and your family safe when you\"re out:Put valuable possessions like laptops or gym bags in the boot of your car at home or the office before you drive somewhere else. Stowing them after you have parked at your destination is simply advertising what valuables you have.Don\"t leave any valuables visible in your car when you park it. Put them in your handbag, the cubby hole or under the seats.Don\"t leave bills that provide your home address in your car.Don\"t leave the remote control that opens your electric gate at home in your car.Always park in a well-lit, well-populated area. Don\"t grab a convenient space that\"s out of sight from the rest of the parking garage or street.If you have any concerns at all about going back to your car after you have been to the shops or a meeting, ask a security guard to accompany you.Always get your keys ready before you approach your car so that there are no extra delays when you are the easiest target for criminals.If you have young children who still need you to strap them in, be extra vigilant about all of these points, because you\"re particularly vulnerable while you stand beside an unlocked vehicle. Many malls now provide parent-and-child parking spaces near an entrance. Use these.And, of course, don\"t forget about car-jamming!Final word  There\"s no denying that car owners are frequent victims of crime in South Africa. But, in many cases, by simply being vigilant and cautious, you can protect your possessions and ensure your safety! "

        "content": "You have been told that property is a great investment and that you should get a foot in the property market as soon as possible. You want to sign on the dotted line but you have no idea of how to go about finding and buying your first home. This is every home buyer\"s A-Z guide.It\"s important to realise that there\"s a lot of legwork that you need to do before you make an offer. So, if you\"re thinking about buying a home, here\"s what you should do before you start the big hunt.1. Save up for a deposit The single most important thing that you can do to improve your chances of getting home loan approval from a bank is saving up for a deposit. It shows the bank that you are serious and financially responsible and it lessens their risk in lending you the money. And it\"s good practice for you to get into the habit of paying back a monthly bond instalment. Aim for 10% of your estimated purchase price, but every little bit helps.  2. Work out what you can afford Use an affordability calculator like the one found here to work out how much you\"re able to spend each month on bond repayments. The calculator asks for your income and expenses and calculates how much you can spend on your new home. Note that your monthly repayments cannot be greater than 30% of your gross monthly income. 3. Get pre-approval Some banks and most bond originators (who submit your bond application to all the banks on your behalf) will issue you a pre-approval certificate. This certificate states what you can afford and confirms that you have a clear credit record. It\"s not an absolute guarantee that you\"ll get the bond you apply for, but it gives you, the estate agent and the seller, a good idea that you will 4. Identify the area in which you want to buy This is often a stumbling block for first-time home buyers because you quickly realise that you can\"t really afford to buy in the area of your dreams. Don\"t give up hope you simply have to lower your expectations of a three bedroom, free-standing starter home, or work out the nearest affordable suburb. Also think about things like your route to work, how close you\"ll be to friends and family and what schools are in the area.  5. Prepare the paperwork Until you\"ve applied for a home loan, you have no idea how much paperwork is involved. When you find the home of your dreams, you\"ll want to act quickly, so be sure that you have copies of the following documents available:  A copy of your ID documentA salary slip less than two months old (or a letter from your accountant if you\"re self-employed)Six months\" worth of bank statementsYou will also need to list your assets and liabilities, so be sure that you know the value of all your lines of credit, policies, investments and valuable possessions.6. Start searching The Saturday newspapers have a property section and you can search by area on various property sites online. It\"s also a good idea to sign up with local estate agents, because they might have something on their books that they\"re not actively marketing but that\"s just right for you. Don\"t househunt with a sense of urgency, but slowly educate yourself about what you can afford in your area.  7. Make an offer When you find the house that you think might just be the one, get ready to make an offer. Remember that estate agents are sales people and will put pressure on you for a higher offer. But you also shouldn\"t make an extremely low offer on principle if you want the property. You\"re entitled to call in a builder or other specialist if you\"re worried about any aspect of the structure. There will often be a bit of negotiating between you and the seller at this stage.8. Apply for a home loan When you get the exciting news that your offer has been accepted, you\"ll have to apply for a home loan. It\"s a good idea to use a bond originator to apply to more than one bank at a time with only one set of paperwork. This ensures that you get the best chances of approval and the lowest possible interest rate. This is where all that paperwork you prepared earlier will come in handy.  9. Hurry up and wait You should hear back about your home loan approval fairly quickly, but it can then take ages for the transfer (when the property is actually put into your name) to go through. Use this time wisely buy things that you need, save up for any hidden expenses and start to plan your life in your new home.  10. Move in Collect your keys and move in. Congratulations on making the biggest investment of your life!  "

        "content": "As tempting as that hot chocolate and sticky toffee pudding might be, there\"s no reason for you to fall off the weight-loss wagon in the winter months. Here are five tips to keep you on the straight and narrow while the days are cold and the nights long.1. Stick to your exercise routine Sorry, but you have to! It feels like midnight in Antarctica at 5am in winter, so if that\"s your gym time, you might find it hard to haul yourself out of bed. Look at your diary and schedule in a couple of lunch-time or evening sessions to make it more bearable. If your usual workout is running or cycling outdoors, find something else to do so you\"re not at the mercy of the weather like hot yoga, or swimming in a heated pool. 2. Eat comfort food, but count your carbs or calories Whether you\"re on a low-carb or low-calorie eating plan (or no plan at all), you\"ll find lots of diet-crashing temptations in winter. Be creative about what you eat: have hearty soups without the cream (or with the cream and without the bread roll), have the lamb bredie but with only a little rice and a big side serving of roast veg. Enjoy the roast chicken, but go easy on the roast potatoes and rice.    3. Step on a scale Keep track of your weight by stepping on a scale twice-weekly. This way you\"ll notice a small increase and will be able to do something about it before it spirals out of control. 4. Watch those hot drinks We often binge on coffee, tea or hot chocolate during winter simply because they keep us warm. If you have milk and sugar, allow yourself no more than your allotted one or two cups a day and use herbal teas with no sweeteners to keep your hands warm the rest of the time. 5. Go easy on the alcohol Red wine, whiskey, gluhwein what would winter be without these things? Alcohol is full of calories, so pace yourself. Try alternating alcoholic drinks with glasses of water.  "

        "content": "Are you struggling to get your kids through school, but also faced with the financial and emotional task of caring for your ageing parents? You are not alone. This condition has become so common that a term has been coined for it: you are a part of the sandwich generation, feeling the pressure of commitment to the generations above and below you.And never mind your commitment to others, many in the sandwich generation are also sacrificing their own savings and retirement plans to take care of everyone else perpetuating the sandwich cycle.There is, unfortunately, no quick fix for people in this position. But there are some approaches that could help you to make the most of a difficult situation.Have a serious discussion with everyone involvedWhen it becomes obvious that your parents will soon be in need of help, hold a meeting with any siblings or other family members to discuss the difficulties and possible solutions. Come to the meeting with a clear idea of what you are willing to do and try to think of realistic solutions to the problems that you\"re faced with. Don\"t do or agree to anything with the expectation of payback or recognition; if you want something in return, say so.Tally assets and expensesAs cold-hearted and clinical as it sounds, you\"ll need to get a good idea of what your parent or parents are worth and of their month-to-month living expenses. This will help you to plan for their care and to work out what can be done for them. For instance, if they sell their house, will the proceeds be enough for you to build a new bedroom or cottage on your property? Look into any other assets they have, and find out about any policies or investments that could help in any way.Help your parent to get an incomeDepending on how old or capable your parent is, there might be a way for them to earn an income with your support. Perhaps your mom could start cooking birthday cakes for kids at your children\"s school or get a half-day receptionist job at your doctor\"s offices. If your dad\"s a handyman, he could do odd jobs in the neighbourhood, or if there is enough money to set him up, perhaps he could open a small framing business.Get help from everyoneWhen your parents\" care is starting to cost you significant money and time, approach your siblings and any other family members that could help out. Discuss the reality of the situation although you should keep them up to date all along and get them to commit to what they can contribute. It\"s never easy asking for money, but this financial burden shouldn\"t be yours alone.Look after yourselfIt is absolutely critical that you don\"t sacrifice your own future while looking after the other generations. Make sure that you keep making realistic contributions to your retirement fund, and don\"t eat into all your savings. Let everyone know that there\"s not enough money to go around. Your children can take out student loans, if need be, and your parents can sell assets or find ways to support you while you earn the money that keeps you all afloat.Give yourself a breakAcknowledge that you are not a superhero and that you sometimes need help and support. Take an evening off, catch up with some friends, go out for a movie or have a treatment at a spa. You are the glue that\"s holding the family together, and if you are too stressed, it just won\"t stick.It can be easy to get bogged down in the admin and difficulties of caring for ageing parents. But it\"s also important to remember that these are the last years that you will have with them. While it\"s not easy, try to treasure this time and to show your children compassion and empathy for the elderly, because one day, you will be in the same position."

        "content": "As the newly single Cressida Bonas has shown the world, being beautiful, rich and famous doesn\"t necessarily mean you\"ll be able to make a go of it with Prince Charming Harry. While Cressida and Harry\"s break-up is reported to have been amiable, there\"s invariably a great deal of emotional fall-out when a good thing comes to an end.Chances are that you will go through a few break-ups before you settle down with Mr Right. As difficult as these might be especially if you are the dumpee they can also be growing experiences. We spoke to Johannesburg-based clinical psychologist Ruth Ancer about how to get through a break-up in the healthiest possible way. These were her tips:Let it go!The first and most difficult step of getting over a break-up is wanting to get over it. Don\"t try to be best friends. Don\"t drunk-dial him (install an app to stop yourself if you have to). Don\"t try to maintain your friendship with all of his friends. Don\"t beg him to take you back. Don\"t indulge revenge fantasies (too often!). Rather construct a new life that he isn\"t a part of so that you\"re not endlessly reminded that you miss him.Accept your sadnessLetting go doesn\"t mean you won\"t still be sad. In fact, it\"s often only once you really let go that you can property begin to mourn the loss of your partner and the plans you had for a future together. You must remember that mourning is a process and there\"s no quick fix. Allow yourself to wallow in sadness every now and then, but also find distractions and support to remind you that there\"s more to life than him.Work out what went wrongA little reflection is always a good idea. If you think that the break-up might have been your fault, think about what you did and try to work out ways of breaking the cycle. Were you too clingy or too independent? Did you demand too much of him or not give enough of yourself? It\"s also possible that he was just a bad choice of partner to begin with. Ask your friends for their honest insights on what went wrong. But also remember that sometimes relationships just don\"t work out through no fault of your own.Reconnect with your friendsWWhen you\"re in a romantic relationship, you have less time for your friends. Now, they can help to keep you busy and distracted. Plan specific outings or adventures with them like bowling or a pottery class so that you have something specific to do. And while it may be helpful to talk to them about your ex, don\"t become the bore who can\"t talk about anything else.Enjoy the things you couldn\"tAsk your married friends what they most miss about being single. This should give you some good ideas for the fun things you should be doing taking hour-long baths, watching bad chick flicks or eating messy takeaways on the sofa. And if there\"s anything time-consuming that you were putting off like enrolling in a course or starting a yoga class now\"s the time to do it.Find your inner peaceWhile keeping busy and seeing friends are good ways to remind yourself about how much fun life can be, you should also focus on being happy with yourself and by yourself. Meditate, take long walks or redecorate your home. Try to find the things that make you feel good and whole.Don\"t jump straight back on the dating bandwagonIt\"s a good idea to get over a break-up before you start dating someone else. If you\"re using a new relationship as a distraction, it can leave you feeling hollow and dissatisfied and stuck in an unhealthy relationship. Of course, you\"ll always hear stories about the girl who met her husband one month after her ex ditched her, but the reality is that rebound relationships seldom work out. Give yourself time to heal before you start to date again.If you\"re stuckIf you find that after about six months, you aren\"t feeling much better or that there\"s no cause for optimism, it might be worth considering therapy to help you get out of your rut. While some relationships leave permanent scars, there are ways to make those scars a part of who you are without becoming a damaged person.Final wordRuth says that, as hard as it can be to get over a break-up, women often look back and realise that these were the times of their greatest growth or self-discovery. Try to do the best you can for yourself in this time so that you can embrace whatever the future offers as a happy, confident and complete woman."

        "content": "As consumers it\"s overwhelming to make sense of the nutritional claims that companies use to market their products: This will nourish. That will protect. This is good for you. That is rich in fibreâ€¦ It\"s almost impossible to make an informed decision based on what we\"re told because, quite frankly, it\"s all just sales talk, right? Wrong! According to Preetesh Sewraj, the managing director of Product of the Year, South African labels are among the most highly regulated in the world. This means that you can rest easy knowing that the information they carry is true. Preetesh gave us the low-down on how to interpret labels responsibly in our bid to make informed buying decisions for you and your family.What labels must stateThe name of the product and the name and address of its manufacturer have to appear on the label. The address is usually on the back, near the barcode. If you have any queries or complaints about the product, this lets you know how to make contact.The label also has to tell you how to store the product, especially if it\"s poisonous and must be kept away from children and food.If the product is not South African, the label has to tell you where it came from. In South Africa, labels can be in any of the 11 official languages.A label cannot lieSouth African regulations insist that a product has to be able to prove any claim that it makes. So, if you buy a known brand from a reputable store, and it says that it nourishes for 24 hours or is Low GI, you can be sure that the product does exactly that.Recent regulation in South Africa has also declared that words like rich in, excellent source or enriched with may no longer be used on packaging, as the claim has been exploited. The only words that can now be used are free from, low in, high in and very high in.All the ingredients are listedProduct labels whether they\"re on foods, cosmetics or household cleaners have to list all their ingredients. You may not know that the ingredients are listed in order of mass so the ingredient listed first comprises the largest part of the product.Some products will list the actual percentage of important ingredients. For example, dark chocolate will tell you that it contains 80% cocoa solids. This is not a legal requirement, but the manufacturers do it when they know it might be important to you for whipping up a delectable chocolate mousse cake.The leading allergens dairy, eggs, gluten, nuts, shellfish must be listed separately so that anyone with an allergy can avoid them. Remember, if anyone in your family is allergic to something unusual they should be advised to read the entire ingredient list before sampling any of the contents.Additives like MSG, tartrazine and sulphur dioxide should be declared on labels, and will definitely be mentioned by name in the ingredients list.Information about things that are important to youSouth Africans are a diverse bunch, so manufacturers will let you know if a product is halaal, kosher, vegan, vegetarian, free range or organic.Labels like endorsed by the Heart and Stroke Foundation mean that the product has been assessed by that organisation to suit a healthy lifestyle.It\"s not a legal obligation for labels to state any of these things but, if they are stated, you can be sure that they are true.Expiry dates and batch numbersFood products have a use-by date, after which the product is seen as not fit for consumption. Always check these dates before putting food items into your trolley to avoid disappointment when you get home. Cosmetics, on the other hand, have a best-before date, after which they can still be sold, but you must be aware that the moisturiser or nail varnish might not be as soft or shiny as a new one. Also take into consideration how long the product needs to last you and then rather opt for one that hasn\"t gone past its best-before date.Batch numbers are generally printed on the product in a line of ink dots. These are useful if you have a complaint so the manufacturer can work out if any other products from the same batch have also turned out badly.The symbols on the labelPlastic packaging always has a triangle with a number inside it, which explains the type of plastic that has been used, so that recyclers can process it in the right way.There\"s always a barcode, and the first three letters of the barcode show you where the product is manufactured but under South African law, the label must state the origin of the product.When it comes to cosmetics, there\"s usually a symbol that looks like a canister with its lid popped open and a number and the letter m beneath it. This advises the length of time that you can use a product after opening it. You may be surprised to learn how soon your shampoo or cleanser expires!Pay attention!So little space, so much information! After reading this list, you\"ll never look at labels in the same way again. And that\"s a good thing you\"re now a more informed consumer!"

        "content": "You made an offer on your dream home and it was accepted. Then the bank approved your bond and finally you are a homeowner. But now you\"re in limbo, waiting for the transfer to go through so that you can move into your new home and truly call it your own.You might be tempted to devote your last months of financial freedom to spending piles of money frivolously before the burden of bond repayments kick in. But there are actually some sensible things you should be doing with your savings that will help to establish you as a responsible home owner.Save, save, saveYou saved for a deposit, soon you\"ll be paying back a bond - surely you deserve a little break? Wrong! When you move into your new home, you\"re going to be met with any number of unexpected expenses like broken plumbing, sagging cupboard doors and missing keys. It really is sensible to save a nest egg to help you pay for these unexpected costs.Buy what you need well most of itDepending on where you live now, you may need to buy new furniture or appliances, but don\"t go overboard. First, draw up a budget and a wish list and rank the items on it in order of priority. You\"ll certainly need a bed and a fridge right away, but a dining room table or a television can wait a couple of months. And you can do up the guest bedroom next year.If you find you can\"t afford much of what you want, try visiting factory shops, second-hand stores and auctions. You\"ll be amazed at the bargains you can find. And remember that it\"s very important not to go into credit so that you end up paying back a fortune in interest on a flat-screen TV. You\"re going to be paying back a big enough line of credit soon enough, so only spend money you actually have for the time being.Plan for repairsAsk your estate agent to ask the seller if you can go and have a look around the property. List all the things that you would like to do to your new home, again in order of priority, and then get quotes or cost items yourself in the hardware store. You might not be able to live with a blood-red lounge, but remember that paint is expensive, so only do the whole house if you absolutely have to.Do the boring adminFind out what needs to be done to get the rates, electricity, water, gas and phone put into your name. Arrange to have an ADSL line installed if you need one at home. Decide whether you want additional security features, and get quotes from different providers in the area many will offer a free security system if you sign up with them. These processes take time, so start doing them right away so that you don\"t have to wait when you move in. And remember to keep a record of all these expenses for budgeting purposes.Sort out your insuranceYour bank requires you to have homeowners insurance or buildings insurance, which covers structural problems, burst geysers and pipes and natural disasters. But you may not know that you don\"t have to take the cover that your bank offers you you can shop around. You\"ll also need to get quotes for household insurance to insure your existing and new household contents. You have to do this even if you have existing cover as your risk profile may change depending on the security features and location of your new home, plus you have all your new items to insure. If you have a car, you\"ll also have to let your insurance provider know that your address will be changing.If you take these steps, you\"ll find moving day and settling in to your new home a lot less stressful. And being financially conservative now will help you prepare for the biggest financial commitment of your life paying off your bond. Good luck with the big move."

        "content": "If you\"ve spent your life avoiding butter and cutting the fat off meat, you might be finding the recent spate of health announcements that fat is your friend a little surprising. In South Africa, the high-fat, low-carb (HFLC) eating plan is championed by Professor Tim Noakes, whose recipe book The Real Meal Revolution (Quivertree Publications) is filling dieters\" stomachs with bacon, cheese and cream, while still promising a diminishing waistline.So what\"s the deal? Can you eat as much fat as you like and still lose weight? And what about carbs? Why are they so bad? If you\"d like to lose weight and are baffled by the barrage of conflicting information, we\"ve taken the pain out of the puzzle for you.Understanding traditional weight-loss diets If you ignore all the different fad diets out there and see a qualified dietician, you will be put on a calorie-restricted diet. This basically means that you use a little scale and you count every calorie that goes into every plate of food you eat. Then you do a calculation and you make sure that you stay under a certain amount of calories for the day. Women should never consume less than 1 200 calories a day and more if they exercise.The bonus: You\"ll lose weight, steadily but surely. And you\"ll be able to have cheat days and still enjoy all the food groups.The downside: You\"ll have to restrict most things that are delicious like full cream and sugar and will probably feel hungry or dissatisfied most of the time.The long term: When you\"ve lost the weight, you can increase your calorie intake to a maintenance level and, if you start to put on a couple of kgs, you can just cut back again.Understanding high-fat, low carb Although HFLC is making the headlines at the moment, it\"s not a new concept. In the early 19th century, William Banting, a morbidly obese dietician was instructed to follow this diet previously used only on diabetics and he lost a huge amount of weight. That\"s why following this diet is today known as banting.The HFLC diet has made a reappearance in many forms over the years. Both Atkins and Paleo to a certain extent have characteristics of HFLC. But, in its purest form, it amounts to reducing your intake of carbohydrates that\"s all starches and sugars to less than 50g to 100g a day. A further reduction to 25g is known as the ketone diet, which is supposed to bring on extremely rapid weight loss.Then, to make up for the lost carbs, you eat loads of animal fat and certain vegetable oils like olive oil or avocado oil. The (fairly well tested) theory is that without the spike in insulin that comes after eating carbohydrates, you won\"t store this fat. In addition, because fat is satisfying to your body, you\"ll be less hungry and less likely to binge or snack. You\"re still supposed to eat piles of veg, but almost no fruit. But you can have cream in your coffee.The other thing about true HFLC is that it\"s not supposed to be a diet but rather a lifestyle. You train your brain to get its energy from fat instead of carbs so, if you go back to carbs, your weight will start to go up again.The bonus: If you do it right with no cheating, you\"ll lose a lot of weight fairly quickly. They say you\"ll have more energy and get fitter too. Also, you\"ll feel satisfied. You might dream of noodles and risotto or cheesecake, but you can always have bacon. The downside: You will miss carbs. And you will probably regain some (if not all) of the weight you lost if you go back to eating them.The long term: HFLC is not a crash diet; it\"s for life. There is increasing evidence that carbs are quite bad for you in any form, but going almost carb-free forever is a challenge.The bottom line The two weight-loss approaches are so contradictory that it\"s hard to work out which one to choose. Most doctors and dieticians still recommend a low-calorie diet as the tried-and-tested way to lose weight healthily. On the other hand, people are seeing incredible results with HFLC, and the dieting process is far easier than a low-calorie diet because you can always eat bacon. But you have to be willing to stick to it for the duration which is forever."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Nobody likes to think about retirement planning. Young women feel that they have all the time in the world to start worrying about their golden years. More mature women probably have a whole lot of other financial commitments like bond repayments and school fees to worry about. And older women well, older women have probably started to worry about their retirement, but by then, it is often too late.The problem, as Ricky Rohrbeck, a financial advisor at SI Advisors, explains, is that most businesses now use a cost to company model for paying their staff. This means that everything that a company used to do for you, you now have to do for yourself. The chances that you are choosing to allocate 15% of your salary to a retirement plan are pretty slim, aren\"t they?Get an early startUnfortunately, Rohrbeck says most people underestimate the importance of getting an early start on retirement savings. If you think you will need R10 000 a month in today\"s terms after retirement, and you start saving at 30, work until you are 60 and live until you are 80, you\"ll need R10 000 a month for the 240 months after you retire. That means you have 30 years to save R2 400 000 or R6 700 a month. That\"s a frightening amount of money that you should be putting away. However, if you\"d started in your 20s, you\"d have to put awayR5 000 a month, which is a little more manageable.Of course, this calculation should take into account compound interest (the interest you earn on the interest you\"ve earned), inflation and investment returns, which is why it\"s important to speak to a financial advisor to get a clear picture.Expenses you won\"t haveIt\"s not all gloom and doom, though. There are some expenses that you probably won\"t have when you retire. By then, your children should be out of school and financially independent. You should own your own home, and can possibly even downsize (although smaller apartments often have higher levies). You won\"t be paying for a medical aid for your whole family, and can probably downgrade your cover to a good hospital plan.It\"s also worth remembering that many women have second careers after retirement. You could continue with your current career part time or open a small business, so your income won\"t necessarily come to an abrupt halt on the day of your retirement.Where to investThe next thing to consider is how to invest your retirement savings. It\"s very important that you invest in a designated retirement annuity, because then the money that you put aside will be tax deductible. This means that you won\"t pay tax on the portion of your income that you save for your retirement, which is a big bonus.The retirement annuity you invest in should get you around 3% more in returns than annual inflation rate, so that your money grows as you invest it. A financial advisor can recommend which retirement annuity you should invest in. Remember that retirement annuities are never going to offer you whopping returns; just slow, steady, inflation-beating growth.The bottom lineThe single most important thing to do about your retirement is to start saving early. Now. Right away. Yesterday. And as much as you can. You owe it to your future self to deny yourself some luxuries now to make sure that you can enjoy your old age free from financial worries."

It might sound too good to be true but, with a bit of thought and planning, you can work out a way to earn a little something extra on the side. The secret to success lies in hard work, dedication and of course in believing in yourself and your dream. These are the practical steps you have to take now start believing!Step 1: Get thinkingYour first and perhaps your most challenging step is to work out if you will sell a product or a service and what that will be. Products might include selling clothes or crafts at a local market if you are good with your hands. Services could include housesitting, tutoring students, dog-walking or taking your skills freelance, for example: design, writing or bookkeeping. Think about what you are good at and how you can turn your skills into cash.Step 2: Get realPlan to spend some time researching your market. Remember there has to be significant demand for your product or service. Who are your customers and where are they? What do they need and how can you help them? You also need to research your competitors - who they are, what products/services they offer and how you will be able to match or improve on their offering.Step 3: Get going Once you know who you are selling to and who your competitors are you need to price your product or service competitively and work out where you will be selling it. If you need to source raw materials for a product, do some research to find out where you can source your supplies at the best possible price. You also need to come up with a clear strategy for how you will market yourself. Do you need a website, for example, or flyers to be handed out at robots?Work in progress...Starting a new business, whatever it is, is not easy. You need to hang in there, keep marketing and, of course, keep believing. You also need to listen to your customers and learn from their feedback. Don\"t be afraid to go back to the drawing board to reevaluate your offering to cater to your customer\"s needs.Great resourcesLooking for more information?

Or maybe you\"re looking to save a little bit extra towards home renovations or a dream holiday? Whatever your reason there\"s nothing stopping you from getting out there and earning the money you need."

        "content": "Losing weight is hard and keeping it off even harder. We all know that battling the bulge requires discipline and persistence, not forgetting never-ending meal planning and many hours on the treadmill. But what if, despite your best efforts, you\"re not losing weight?If your jeans just keep getting tighter and you\"re too scared to step on the bathroom scale? There are a number of medical reasons why you cannot shed your excess weight or why you\"re gaining weight for no apparent reason. Here are our top four:1. Hypothyroidism An underactive thyroid can slow down your metabolism, which could lead to weight gain. Other symptoms of an underactive thyroid are fatigue, sensitivity to cold, joint pain, hair loss and muscle weakness. If you suspect your thyroid might be underactive, visit your doctor and he/she will run the necessary tests.2. Prescription medications There are many medications that can cause weight gain. Some of the more common culprits include birth control pills, steroids, antidepressants, beta-blockers and antiepileptics. If you notice weight gain a few weeks or months after you start taking a new medication, it\"s advisable to speak to your doctor. Remember that you should never discontinue any medication without the help and advice of a doctor.3. StressOngoing anxiety can increase your levels of the hormone cortisol, which could lead to an increase in the most dangerous form of fat, abdominal fat. Learning to manage your stress levels will benefit you physically and mentally.4. Food intolerances It\"s estimated that one in 10 people suffer from food intolerances. The most common troublemakers are dairy, gluten, eggs, nuts and even soya. The symptoms of food intolerances include nausea, bloating, gas and, yes, weight gain! If you think that you\"re intolerant of a certain food, eliminate it from your diet for at least three weeks to see if your symptoms improve.Final word The reasons listed above are only the start of a list of factors that could be causing weight gain. If you suspect that your weight problems are medically related your first step should be to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your concerns. If you\"ve been troubled by unexplained weight gain we certainly hope you find out why and that you\"re happily reunited with your bathroom scale!"

We should exercise more, worry less, take off our make-up before bed time, eat healthily and keep a close eye on how much caffeine, sugar and salt we consume. Except that new research now indicates that salt isn\"t the health villain it\"s made out to be.Even the South African government is having its say against salt, as reported in a recent article at mg.co.za. The government\"s aim is to reduce salt consumption down from 40g a day to 5g a day - as recommended by the World Health Organisation. It hopes to reduce the amount of heart attacks, stroke or death among the South African population as a result of high blood pressure.The link between salt and high blood pressure or hypertension is well-known, but studies in the past few years have shown that this link isn\"t as strong as we\"ve always believed. Seven studies carried out in the US involving 6 350 subjects found no strong evidence that cutting salt intake reduces the risk of heart attacks, stroke or death in people with normal or high blood pressure.So, what should the average health-conscious woman do about the amount of salt she consumes? And should we be doing everything we can to reduce our intake, or do these studies mean we can enjoy a packet of salt and vinegar chips, guilt-free? We spoke to Joburg-based GP Isabel Thompson to find out how to stay healthy in a salt-mad world.According to Dr Thompson, salt is not automatically bad for you and isn\"t automatically going to give you high blood pressure. She says that, if you\"re cooking fresh, locally grown, seasonal food and adding a little salt to suit your taste, you\"re in the clear.The problem instead lies in the processed foods in which salt is used as a preservative. The salt in processed foods accounts for 60% of the salt consumed by South Africans, which is why the government has brought in its new regulations for the reduction of salt in these foods. Essentially, as far as possible, we should be avoiding TV dinners, packet sauces, stock and gravy powders, flavour enhancers, tinned foods, sausages, crumbed meat, fish or chicken and any other salted store-bought food. And not just because they are high in salt. As Dr Thompson points out there\"s a whole lot more wrong with these foods than just their salt content!The bottom line is that you shouldn\"t worry too much about your salt intake if most of what you eat is healthy, home cooked, balanced food. And, if that\"s the case, then Dr Thompson says by all means go out and eat a packet of chips dosed in salt when the urge takes you. Just always remember to drink lots of water."

A good rule of thumb is that, if any of the following symptoms persist for more than two to four weeks, the person is probably depressed and should consult a doctor.Sad mood/ hopeless and pessimisticLack of interest in hobbies and other activitiesSleeping too much or too littleDecrease or increase in appetitePhysical complaintsThoughts of death/suicideCannot concentrate/forgetfulLoss of energy/fatigueLoss of confidence/low self-worthCannot perform at workHow do you help?Most men would rather clean out the garage than talk about their feelings. If you think that your partner is depressed it might be counterproductive to try to get him to open up\" to you. Simply ask him if he has noticed a change in his mood and if he would be open to getting help. Suggest that he consults with a doctor that he trusts or gets help from a psychologist or psychiatrist. A good idea is to ask a male figure that he is close to speak to him and suggest he gets help an uncle, brother or friend.Top TipsNever take his mood personallyDon\"t be judgementalShower him with love and affection and be patient and supportiveHelp him to avoid stressful situations now might not be the best time to organise that family reunionTry not to get frustrated because he refuses to talk to you or admit that anything is wrongThe pain inside Statistics from Australia show that more men commit suicide than women even though women suffer more from depression than men. Why is this? Sadly, men do not get the help they need to treat depression and resort not only to substance and alcohol abuse but also to taking their own lives. As a mother, wife or partner, try and help the guy in your life to understand that it\"s ok to be sad and vulnerable and to ask for help - and that neither are a sign of weakness!Resources If you need help dealing with your partner\"s depression or anxiety, contact The South African Depression and Anxiety Group\"s Mental Health line on 011 262 6396 or visit their website at www.sadag.org for more info on depression and even a depression test. SADAG also hosts a number of support groups for those suffering from depression and anxiety many of which are run by men."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Sometimes, in the workplace, it can be tricky to work out where casual compliments or flirtation end and sexual harassment begins. For example, Nice dress! might not be a problem. But Nice legs in that dress! could be awkward. And Nice well, you get the idea.Of course, at the other end of the spectrum, there are the very clear cases of sexual harassment that leave you feeling stunned and tearful. This could be your boss offering you a raise or promotion in return for some kind of sexual favour, or, even worse, touching you inappropriately.Whichever it is, it has to stop. You must take a stand not only to protect yourself but also to protect the rights of all women. We spoke to Linda Gouveia, a labour consultant at the Labour Workshop, about what you should do if someone\"s advances in the work place are making you uncomfortable or are outright inappropriate. This is what she said.Step 1: Ask him to stopIf you\"re feeling uncomfortable about a colleague\"s inappropriate flirtation or observations, ask him politely to stop. He may be unaware that he\"s overstepping a mark, and a polite request could be all you need to do to get him to leave you alone. Remember that different women find different things offensive, so approach this from your own perspective: I feel uncomfortable when you...If you find it difficult to tackle him face to face or on your own, you can also do this on email or ask a colleague to accompany you when you confront him.Step 2: Lay a complaintIf he doesn\"t stop, or if you\"re the victim of a clear case of harassment, lay a complaint with his line manager or the HR department to make sure that it\"s addressed. Most companies will have a policy in place for dealing with this type of complaint, which should state that harassment will not be tolerated, in line with the CCMA\"s Code of Good Practice on Sexual Harassment.Don\"t be put off by a fear of making waves. He is in the wrong for his action, not you for your reaction.Step 3: Formal or informal proceduresOnce a complaint has been laid, the next step is a grievance procedure. You may have some say in whether an informal or formal grievance procedure is followed, or the HR or line manager involved may decide which is the most appropriate measure.In an informal grievance procedure, an HR representative or line manager will have a discussion with the offender, allow him to tell his side of the story and then caution him about repeating his behaviour. In a formal grievance procedure, there may be a hearing and the warning will go on record, possibly even leading to dismissal.Even if you find this uncomfortable or difficult, it\"s so important to stick to your guns! You need your harasser to stop, and this is the only way to do it.Step 4: If the harassment continuesThere\"s another important reason for laying an official complaint: there is always a possibility that the harassment won\"t stop. In that case, it\"s important to have a record of the problem from as early as possible so that further action can be taken with an understanding of the full history.You will have to lay an additional complaint with HR or the relevant line manager. While you may be discouraged by the fact that nothing came of it the first time, take heart that a repeat harassment should be taken a lot more seriously.Step 5: Appealing for outside helpIn some cases, it might be difficult or impossible to get the results you\"d hoped for out of your harasser or your employer. The company could be very small, the harasser very senior or the appropriate action might not be taken by management. If you\"ve tried every internal route with no meaningful results, then you can take the company to the CCMA to elicit an objective outcome.There have been cases where the CCMA has accepted documented proof of sexual harassment as evidence of constructive dismissal this is when resigning is the only option in an intolerable working environment and ordered the company to compensate the victim financially. While this should be a last resort, you can rest easy knowing that the matter of sexual harassment is taken so seriously by our legal framework.Final word Don\"t be afraid to stand up for your rights, especially in the workplace, where you deserve only respect and support. Be strong and fight the good fight not only for yourself but for the thousands of other women out there who are victims of sexual harassment."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Becoming a mother changes your life in an instant. From the moment your baby is put into your arms your priorities shift dramatically and that bundle of joy is all that matters.All to often, however, new mothers say that they find it difficult to balance the needs of their child with their own needs. Yes, just about the first lesson of motherhood is one of extreme selflessness. But, at the same time, it\"s also extremely important for new mothers to look after themselves. As the most important person in your baby\"s life, you need to make sure that you\"re healthy, happy and fit so that you can take the best possible care of both of you.Feeling a little overwhelmed? Here are six tips for all you marvellous mommies out there:Eat rightIf you\"re breastfeeding and even if you are not you need a balanced diet to keep up those energy levels. You can easily fall into the trap of trying to live on toast and tea, but this diet will soon take its toll. Try roasting a tray of ready-cut vegetables and grilling some chicken breasts at the beginning of the week so that, when you need a snack, there\"s a healthy one just waiting for you in the fridge. Eat lots of fruit and vegetables, lean meat and good fats. Don\"t count calories to lose the pregnancy weight. Now is the time to nourish yourself and your baby, so enjoy it.As hard as it may be, avoid caffeine and alcohol as much as possible. And remember to keep hydrated with lots of water especially if you\"re breastfeeding. It\"s also a good idea to keep taking your prenatal vitamins while you\"re breastfeeding for that extra boost of nutrients.Get some exerciseYour gynaecologists probably told you to wait for six weeks after the birth of your baby before you start to exercise again. But there\"s no harm in taking gentle walks as soon as you feel ready.The trick to getting back into a fitness routine is finding the time. If you find it difficult to leave your baby, try to find mom-and-baby yoga classes in your area, or go for brisk walks with your baby in a pram or sling. As you grow more confident and your baby settles into a routine, try to find more regular gaps to do a combination of cardio, weights, stretching and toning to get your heart pumping and your body feeling great.Get some sleep!The first six months to a year of a baby\"s life will be an experiment in sleep deprivation for you. The best advice anyone will ever give you is to sleep when the baby sleeps. Let go of any other commitments you may have. Don\"t read or cook or email, no matter how tempting it seems. As soon as that baby\"s eyes are shut, put yourself to bed. Or, even better, sleep with your baby.Take turns with your partner to have weekend lie-ins, enlist your friends and family to come and hold your baby for an hour, and grab a nap whenever you can. A little shut-eye will do wonders for your mood and your energy levels.Take time for yourselfWhen your life is all about bottles and blankies and burping and bums, it can be easy to lose track of the outside world. Make sure you get some time away from your baby, even if it\"s only half an hour a week to have a decaf cappuccino at your local coffee shop or to read a book in the bath.Get by with a little help from your friendsRemember how excited all your friends and family were when they found out you were pregnant? They\"re all even more excited now that you\"ve had the baby, and they\"d all love to help you out. Don\"t be afraid to ask for favours. If you feel like you\"re not coping, call them in and make them make tea and bring cake! Friends and family are just as happy to spend time with your baby as with you so, if you\"ve asked them to come, don\"t feel obliged to entertain them.If you feel that you are not copingA rule of thumb is that if you\"re feeling overwhelmingly sad and that you are not coping or you\"re struggling to bond with your baby, you may have a case of post-natal depression. Speak to your GP, gynaecologist or therapist if you suspect that this may be the case, or you can contact the Post Natal Depression Support Association for advice or support.Final word To be the best mother you can be to your newborn child you need to be physically and emotionally healthy. As hard as it might seem, don\"t let your wellbeing take a back seat. Remember, you are the most important person in your baby\"s life!"

        "description": "",
        "content": "There\"s nothing more terrifying than approaching a road block knowing you have outstanding fines that need to be paid. Did you know that it\"s not legal for traffic police to arrest you at the roadside for unpaid fines? Know your rights and you can protect yourself against unscrupulous policemen.Avoiding arrestAccording to Howard Dembovsky, chairman of the Justice Project, outstanding traffic fines don\"t ever have to be paid at the roadside. Furthermore, under the Criminal Procedure Act, an individual may only be arrested if the police officer holds a warrant of arrest for you, which policemen at a roadblock could never have with them for every car that they stop.If you do find yourself in a situation where you\"re being threatened with arrest or the confiscation of your licence at a roadblock, Dembovsky advises that you politely affirm your rights and inform the officers that, in response to their illegal demands, you would have to take legal action against them. In most cases, he says, this will be sufficient to deter them.Remember that in many instances these intimidation tactics are an attempt to illicit a bribe, he says. If you refuse to be intimidated and let them know that you\"re aware of your rights they will let you go in almost all cases.Admitting guilt and paying the fineIf you have an unpaid fine for a traffic infringement that you know you committed there\"s no harm in admitting guilt by paying the fine on the spot.Insist that your teen opens a savings account to save not only wages or pocket money but birthday and Christmas money as well. Make them research the different accounts on offer and find the one with the lowest fees and highest interest rates.Top tips:Insist on paying with a credit or debit card so that you have proof of payment never pay cash!There\"s no such thing as a spot fine this is simply another way of saying bribe.Dealing with fines: just do it!The bottom line is that, if you have received a traffic fine by post, you should pay it if you\"re guilty or query it immediately if you believe you aren\"t.The fine should contain photographic evidence of your transgression and, by looking at the photograph and the date and time information, you should be able to work out if it was in fact you who committed the infringement.The contact details for queries or representations should also be found on the fine. Do not delay and be sure to start the process right away if you believe that you should not be penalised.Final word Remember that the best way to avoid intimidating encounters at roadblocks is to obey the rules of the road! Buckle-up and stay safe, ladies!"

        "content": "A very wise person once said that you cannot prepare the world for your children but you can prepare your children for the world. Every parent knows however that this is easier said then done. In a world gone mad how do you raise children equipped with the skills they need to survive and flourish? If your children are teens (or perhaps even tweens) here are six lessons that will help them take on the world and win!The basics: homemaking 101 Give teenagers chores around the house so that they learn how to clean and keep things neat and tidy. Accept that their bedroom is their own space endless arguments about clothes left on the floor will only put unnecessary strain on an already difficult relationship!As adults in training, teenagers should also understand the basics of good nutrition one of the simplest rules you can teach them is to make sure that at least half of their plate is veg or fruit, for example.You should also teach them the basic rules of healthy cooking (no deep-frying, trim excess fat off meat, lightly steam vegetables etc.) and show them how to cook a few basic meals, from shopping for the ingredients to cleaning up afterwards!Money wise Every teenager should have a part-time job. Not only will it prepare them for the workplace but it will also teach them how to manage and save money. Children under the age of 16 are not allowed to work in South Africa but they could babysit for friends or even clean Mom and Dad\"s car. Older children could work in video stores or as waiters or waitresses, for example. If your child has a particular interest that might develop into a career encourage them to try and look for related work. For example, if they\"re thinking of pursuing a career as a vet they could work at a local animal shelter. This experience will look great on a CV when it comes to finding their first job.A basic lesson in budgeting and monthly expenses is essential if they\"re going to learn to save their hard earned money. A great idea is to make them work out a budget for a winter wardrobe and to ask them to save half of what\"s required, teaching about savings goals and planning.Top tips:Share your annual budget with the kids to show them just how much money is spent on bonds, petrol, cars, food etc. Just remind them that this info is personal and shouldn\"t be shared with their friends.Encourage teenagers to save by giving them R30 for every R100 they save, for example.Remember that pocket money is not a gift or a right. It\"s a privilege or reward that should be earned!The wonders of exercise Encourage teenagers to exercise but make sure it\"s the right exercise. Their workout should be fun and should not take too much time out of their already busy schedules! A girl might enjoy a dance class for example while a boy might enjoy mountain biking with friends or visa-versa! A love of exercise is one of the greatest gifts you can give a child! While your child is partaking in exercise, it\"s unlikely that he or she is abusing any drugs or alcohol. The two just don\"t mix.Top tip: A great way to get teenagers to exercise is to work out with them be it a jog or a session at the gym. It\"s a great way to spend time with them working towards a common goal. This kind of quality time becomes harder and harder to secure as their lives revolve more and more around their friends.Discipline and hard work Life is work whether you\"re studying, working or raising a family, almost every day is going to be about hard work. Teach them not only how to work hard but also that it\"s important to enjoy the rewards of hard work.Gratitude If there\"s one thing most teenagers need to learn it is to be grateful for what they have. Make them aware of how much they have compared to other people in our society and show them that so many of the things they want really don\"t matter in the bigger scheme of things - cellphones, clothes, tablets...Respect If you have a son, one of his first lessons should be to respect women. Male role models in his life be it his father, uncle or family friend should lead by example and treat women with respect. Your daughter needs to be taught about emotional and physical abuse from a young age how to recognise it and how to deal with it.Final word Raising children is not easy. If we have one final word of advice it is to give them love, attention and discipline in equal parts. This is your best recipe for success.For more tips on how to parent like a pro, visit us on Facebook."

        "description": "",
        "content": "You are running from meeting to meeting with no time for a proper meal so you dash into the nearest mall to grab a quick bite. You don\"t want to settle for junk food so you are happy to spot a health food shop. You order a bran muffin and a fresh fruit smoothieand walk out with a spring in your step you have done your body a favour. Except you haven\"t. You, like countless other women, have fallen prey to the health food marketing trap. Yes, many foods promoted as healthy quite simply are not. To help you make better food choices and do your body a real favour here are the top ten healthy foods to avoid.The muffinEven with added bran or fruit, muffins are still made with the same basic ingredients as cake. They are full of sugar and starches simply a carb bomb.Healthy alternative: Snack on fresh fruit and nuts or make yourself a slice of low-GI or wholegrain toast with peanut butter.Sports drinksYou are supposed to have these at the gym, right? That is what they are designed for? Not really. Sports drinks are made to replace electrolytes and give an energy boost to athletes doing intense and long cardiovascular workouts, like running marathons. Sports drinks are packed with calories and sugars that the average exerciser just doesn\"t need.Healthy alternative: Drink water. That is it. Seriously.Brown breadWhile they are still marginally better than plain old white bread, most brown breads simply have only a portion of wholegrain flour and even brown colouring added to their mix. Check labels for breads that are made with wheat flour as the main ingredient (it will appear first on the label) and pass on those.Healthy alternative: Whole grain, multigrain or Low-GI breads made with a large proportion (they will appear first on the label) of wholegrain flour or meal.Juices and smoothiesThe problem with drinking fruit juices is that you are gulping down a huge amount of sugar with no beneficial fibre. Although smoothies contain fruit fibre it has generally been destroyed by the blending process. Also, if you eat fruit, you will generally stop at one serving, but if you drink a juice or smoothie, you are getting the sugar from multiple servings of fruit!Healthy alternative: Eat your fruit; drink water. Put a slice of lemon in your water if you want to add some flavour and make it more palatable.Dressed saladsYou know that salads are good for your health but did you know that many foods on the salad section of the menu are more like desserts? Caramelised nuts, bacon, creamy dressings and croutons are not health foods.Healthy alternative: Order a real salad with the least troublesome ingredients and dress it yourself with lemon, vinegar and olive oil.Low-fat yoghurts, drinking yoghurts and frozen yoghurtsThe common denominator here is the word yoghurt, which has been given a free pass as a healthy food no matter what else has been added to it. Low-fat fruit yoghurts and drinking yoghurts generally have loads of added sugar and frozen yoghurts are packed full of additives and flavourants.Healthy alternative: Choose a low-fat or full-fat unsweetened yoghurt and add your own fruits (berries are great) and minimal sugar or honey if you must.HoneyHoney is really just sugar refined by bees - both contain glucose and fructose. Honey has more calories than sugar but is sweeter so people may use less. While honey does contain small amounts of vitamins and minerals these are not enough to justify heaping spoons of the stuff into your tea.Healthy alternative: There really is no alternative, because artificial sweeteners are not that great for you either. Use sugar or honey in moderation, and try to curb your sweet tooth. If you must use a sweetener, go for something with xylitol and be sure to avoid aspartame.Sugar-free soft drinksAspartame is really bad for you. It can trigger or worsen a host of diseases, including brain tumours, diabetes, lymphoma and epilepsy. And soft drinks are full of other chemicals almost none of them natural and almost all of them bad for you.Healthy alternative: You guessed itâ€¦ drink water.Health barsRemember, just because they are called health doesn\"t mean they are healthy. These bars may promise you high fibre or protein, but that is usually all they have to offer. And again, they are packed full of sugar.Healthy alternative: Snack on an apple, a slice of cheese and some dried fruit for all the purported benefits of a health bar and none of the downsides.Your healthy breakfast cereal The box promises you added nutrients or vitamins but that does not mean that the cerealthey have been added to is good for you. Cereals are generally made by a process called extrusion, which destroys nutrients and forms new, synthetic compounds. Even granola and muesli often have too much added sugar.Healthy alternative: Select cereal or muesli made with whole grains and containing lots of fibre. Check that the sugar content is not too high (the American Heart Association says that women should eat no more than 6 teaspoons of sugar a day, so check your muesli\"s ingredients label and keep track of your other sources of sugar.Final word Remember, there is no reason to drop all these foods entirely. Just remember that despite the healthy branding they aren\"t good for you. Enjoy them as often as you would a slice of cake or an English breakfast."

        "description": "",
        "content": "On 11 February the British Medical Journal published a Canadian study that showed that regular mammography does not reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women. It goes without saying that the media went crazy with headlines around the world shoutin, Mammograms do not save lives!With the new finding, how does this change your opinion on mammogram testing? And what new measures should you employ to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer? We spoke to South African breast surgeon Dr Sarah Rayne to find the answers for you.What did the study say?The 25-year study, which tracked nearly 90 000 middle-aged women, concluded that annual mammography does not result in a reduction in the number of deaths as a result of breast cancer when compared to self-examination and annual medical check-ups. In short, the study suggested that the value of mammography should be re-evaluated. But don\"t cancel your annual mammogram just yet.The facts behind the research Dr Rayne explains that the study was conducted in Canada where women are well-educated about their health backed by an efficient government healthcare system. Sadly, this is not the case in South Africa! Even the study\"s authors acknowledged that the results would probably not be the same in other countries.Furthermore, the information in the study was based on mammograms carried out 25 years ago and mammography has become a lot more advanced since then. The medical fraternity also has concerns about the way in which the study was carried out as other studies have shown a reduction in deaths as a result of early detection of cancer by mammograms.In a nutshell, while this study may have cast public doubts on the value of mammography, doctors remain confident that mammogram tests are the best way to detect and protect against breast cancer. As a result, the medical fraternity is not revising its recommendations around the frequency of mammograms just yet.Breast health 101 You should carry out breast self-examinations at the same time every month and have an annual clinical examination by a medical practitioner. After the age of 40, you should have a mammography at intervals recommended by your practitioner.The most important thing is to be breast aware, Dr Rayne says. Examine your breasts, or have them examined by a physician. If you do find something to be concerned about, make sure that you get an answer as to what it is which will almost always involve some sort of imaging such as an ultrasound or mammogram.By being breast aware and taking responsibility of your health, you can significantly reduce the risk of developing breast cancer, which affects one in 31 women in South Africa.Any questions?If you\"re concerned breast cancer-related questions, get in touch with Dr Rayne by visiting the Netcare Breast Care Unit website and clicking on the button Ask Dr Sarah\". She also holds a free breast examination clinic on Wednesday mornings at the Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg.Good to know!Breast cancer: know your risk Certain women are more at risk of contracting breast cancer than others.

        "content": "Your kids are almost grown up and ready to leave the nest. You have seen them grow from sweet smiling babies to moody high school students. Now they have completed their studies and want to enter the job market. But with South Africa\"s unemployment rate hovering somewhere around 24% they are going to need all the help they can get.Unfortunately, merely holding a matric certificate or a degree in their hands is not enough to get your children through the door of a potential employer. Your young job seeker will have to think about how they present their qualifications, expertise and interests, how they look, how they appear on social media and how to balance standing out in the interview with fitting into the workplace.We spoke to Shelagh Foster, author of Your First Year of Work A Survival Guide, about what a job seeker should do to increase their chances of getting the right job, fast.Here\"s what she had to say; advice you can pass over to your son or daughter:Get some experience You should think about getting work experience before you start compiling a CV and searching the job pages. Holiday internships show a real commitment to and basic understanding of your chosen field. Regular charity, NGO, fundraising or committee work shows that you care about your fellow man and are prepared to get work experience without wanting anything in return.Look for work everywhere Obviously you should look in the job pages in the newspaper and online, but when searching for a job the adage, It\"s not what you know, it\"s who you know, is particularly true. Write a polite letter or email to anyone you know in the appropriate profession or area, tell them about your qualifications and interests and ask them to please bear you in mind. You will be surprised by how many leads you turn up.Get your CV right The most important thing is to find out how individual employers prefer a CV to be submitted. If they have an online template, use that. If they ask for two pages, stick to that. You are making their lives easier and you are showing that you can follow a simple instruction. You also need to bear the following in mind:Your CV should have no spelling or grammar mistakes get someone to edit for youThere should be consistency in the use of heading styles and bold and italic text.Don\"t waffle - be concise but not terse.Don\"t be afraid to tweak your CV to match a particular organisation or industry. This is particularly relevant for your covering letter.If you are submitting your CV by email, what you write in the subject line is all-important. Application for economics internship at Company X and your name will suffice. Remember there is no spell check for the subject line so read through your copy carefully before hitting the send button.Mention your non-academic qualities as well. Employers are always interested in young people who show leadership skills, are solutions driven, strive for consistent improvement and who are team players.Express your interests as long as they are appropriate. For all you know, the fact that you are a Sea Scout, or that you write music or read Proust will resonate with your prospective employer. If, however, any of your interests are at all likely to clash with those of your interviewer, leave them out. This includes political affiliations, sports teams supported or anything that might be seen as radical.The interview: dressing for success Find out how most people in that workplace tend to dress and go one step more formal. Your clothes need not be expensive, but they must be spotless. Cover any tattoos and remove any visible piercings (other than earrings for women), unless the industry dictates otherwise. Accept that you might need to change your hairstyle. Don\"t wear pants that are too tight or blouses that are too low cut. Don\"t teeter on stilettos. Go easy on scented deodorant and perfume. And make sure that your breath is fresh.In the interview, be informed and confident but not cocky, humble but not too reserved and ask intelligent questions. Express an interest and basic knowledge of the organisation to which you are applying.Fix your social media profilesNo matter what your privacy settings, long before you start looking for a job, you should clean up your social media presence. Ask friends to delete unsuitable comments and start presenting yourself in a professional light, even on fun social media platforms. Make sure you delete anything negative you may have said about any of the organisations to which you might be applying!Final word These tips should help your child to take their first step into the big world of work. Remember, they only get one chance to make a first impression, so help them to make the right one and start a long and happy career.About Shelagh Foster Shelagh Foster is the author of Your First Year of Work A Survival Guide, published by Bookstorm, and available on Kalahari.com."

        "content": "The bride was beautiful and the groom ever so handsome. After a dream wedding they drove off into happily ever after to raise a family and grow old together. Or maybe not. In the Justice Department\"s annual report for 2012-2013, 50 517 divorce cases were recorded a massive increase on the 39 573 cases in the previous year. Simply put, divorce is a hard and fast reality. As unromantic as it may sound, every bride-to-be has to discuss divorce and ante-nuptial contracts with her husband to be.What is a marriage contract? The best way to protect both partners in a marriage is by signing an ante-nuptial contract or ANC. We spoke to a lawyer to get the low-down on ANCs and why you should not say I do\" before you have signed on the dotted line.A contact governs what happens in the matrimonial relationship and what must happen should the partners divorce, he says. It comes into play if the marriage relationship does break down and gives certainty as to how the separate estates must be dealt with.In a marriage without an ANC, the two partners and their respective estates become joint. Should the marriage break down, the assets (including cash and property) and liabilities (for example debt) are split equally between the two parties. This is referred to as being married in community of property. However, when an ANC is in place, it governs exactly how those assets and liabilities should be split.The contract will usually give numbers a value to every asset that each partner has when they enter into the marriage, so that in the unfortunate event of a split, the division of assets is much simpler and quicker.An ANC is also extremely useful for dividing the financial responsibilities of both parties during the marriage. Without a contract in place, the one party can be held liable for the debts of the other in other words your husband\"s creditors could attach your car if he defaults on his loans. If a contract is in place, each person\"s debts and liabilities are their own.The different types of contracts There are two types of contracts:An ANC: This is a contract that states that the two parties are completely separate financial entities, and that what they bring to the union, they can take with them when they leave. What they earn or come to owe during the course of their marriage is also their responsibility should it dissolve.An ANC with accrual: This states the assets and liabilities with which each partner comes to the marriage are their own, but allows for the growth of assets during the course of the marriage to be split between the parties in the event of a divorce. This is a good way of acknowledging that two people have contributed to the life that the couple builds together, and should be able to share equally in the benefits if it breaks down. Creditors cannot in this case attach the assets of the other party.If a couple were married in a traditional or religious ceremony that is not a recognised civil union, the courts will still generally allow for an equal split of the growth of assets during the marriage in essence, treating the union as if a contract that allowed for accrual was in place. The courts will even try to do this in the case of two individuals who have been living together as if they were married, although it is more difficult in this case to mark a starting point of the union.Of course, the maintenance paid for any children born either inside or outside of a marriage is calculated independently of what the two parties may or may not owe each other.Why you should have the conversation Discussing the possibility of divorce at what should be a happy and optimistic time may not sit well with both partners in an engagement, but it is an important, practical step to take. It can even be considered to be an act of love to make sure that if there is a future time at which the marriage falls apart, the best possible outcome has been planned for from the beginning.Sitting down together and talking openly about finances and the future is also a very good way to start a marriage that will last a lifetime."

Dubbed the new nicotine\" sugar can cause obesity, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and even premature ageing. The fact is that sugar is not a food but a chemical and a highly addictive and dangerous one at that. If you want to eat less sugar - or preferably cut it out altogether - then you need to be aware of the sugar hidden in seemingly innocent everyday foods. Here is a cheat sheet.Some of the common culprits  The following foods often contain sugar so be vigilant when adding them to your shopping basket:Peanut butterSalad dressingsCerealsBreadCanned soup and vegetablesTomato sauceYoghurtFast foodsUnfortunately the list of foods that could contain sugar is a lot longer than this. If you want to avoid sugar then you need to become a label reader. But it is not as simple as that...The many faces of sugar Sugar can be listed in the ingredients on food labels by any of the following names. To avoid hidden sugars you need to learn to recognise them!Agave nectarBrown sugarCane juice or cane juice crystalsCane sugarCaramelConcentrated fruit juiceCorn sweetenerCorn syrupCrystalline fructoseDextroseEvaporated cane juiceFructoseGalactoseGlucoseHigh-fructose corn syrupHoneyHydrolysed starchInvert sugarLactoseMaltoseMalt syrupMolassesRaw/brown sugarSucroseSyrupTreacleOnce you have learnt to spot hidden sugars you will find it a lot easier to control your daily intake and stick within recommended limits or even cut it out of your diet completely.Did you know? Do you know that fruit juice can contain as much sugar as a soft drink? If you simply cannot do without your morning glass of OJ consider diluting it with water - 1 part fruit juice to three parts water.Final word  The American Heart Association recommends no more than 6 teaspoons of added sugar a day that is less than you will find in the average can of soda. (Added sugar refers to sugar added to food and beverages during processing or preparation for example adding sugar to tea). If you are consuming a lot more than this and you want to cut down on your daily intake be sure to do it slowly. Remember that you have probably been consuming too much sugar for most of your life don\"t try and eliminate it from your diet overnight!"

        "content": "Planning for pregnancy and motherhood is a daunting task. It goes without saying that you and your partner have a lot more to think about than just the baby\"s name and the colour of the nursery walls. One of your first priorities should be to ensure that you are in the best possible shape both mentally and physically. Simply put, healthy, happy mothers make healthy, happy babies. Here are nine areas of your health that the experts agree you should start focusing on in the year before you fall pregnant.Get your weight under control Being overweight can make it difficult to fall pregnant, add to the strain on your body and increase your risk of developing gestational diabetes. Being underweight can cause difficulties conceiving and can result in miscarriage or a low birth weight for your baby. If you need help controlling or putting on weight, speak to your doctor and a dietician about the best way to approach this.Get fit  In general, when pregnant, you shouldn\"t start any exercise you weren\"t already doing before you fell pregnant. Make sure that you\"ve started a workout routine that will prepare you for those extra kilograms you\"re going to pack on and for running around after a busy toddler. It will happen sooner than you think! Eat well If there was ever a time to finish your veggies, this is it. Vegetables and fruit provide the nutrients you need to be healthy and to have a healthy baby. Whole grains and low-mercury fish and other lean proteins should also feature in your diet. And you should cut back on sugar and bad carbs like white bread and white rice.  Quit smoking, cut down on alcohol and caffeine  Smoking while pregnant lowers the amount of oxygen available to your baby and increases the baby\"s risk of respiratory problems, premature birth and low birth weight. But the stress of quitting smoking can also have negative effects on a pregnancy, so the best time to quit is right now.Alcohol may reduce fertility in both men and women as well as having an impact on your general health and wellbeing. When trying to fall pregnant, it\"s best to reduce your intake to one to two units a week.The research on caffeine\"s impact on fertility is inconclusive, but when you do fall pregnant you\"ll definitely need to reduce your intake.Start taking folic acid and pregnancy vitamins Folic acid or Vitamin B9 is very important for the development of a healthy foetus. It helps to prevent neural tube defects, which affect around 300 000 babies worldwide each year. Folic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, brown rice and breads and cereals that have been fortified with the vitamin. But it is virtually impossible to get sufficient folic acid from diet alone. Healthcare professionals recommend taking 400 micrograms for at least one month and preferably three months before you fall pregnant as well as throughout your pregnancy.Choose a multivitamin with a combination of Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, iron, selenium and zinc. Most pre-pregnancy vitamins have folic acid in them, but check the dosage to ensure you\"re getting your 400 micrograms.Make sure you\"ve had your MMR vaccination  If you contract rubella or German measles during your pregnancy you could lose your baby, or your baby could be born with multiple defects. Having an MMR vaccination at least a month before you fall pregnant will provide you with immunity against the disease. If you are uncertain about your immunity, ask your doctor for a blood test.Also ask your healthcare professional if there are any other vaccinations that you should have before you fall pregnant.Start to relax Researchers are still exploring the link between stress and infertility, but there\"s no denying that the best way to look after yourself is to reduce your stress levels. Make sure that you get a little me time every week, and find productive ways to tackle all those things in your life that get your blood pressure up.Track your cycle The best time to have sex in order to fall pregnant is in the three days prior to ovulation. This usually takes place on around day 14 of your menstrual cycle (counting the first day of your period as day 1), but every woman\"s cycle is different.If you would like to maximise your chances of falling pregnant, it\"s a good idea to start mapping your cycle, so that you know exactly when your fertile window occurs. There are some great apps to help you do this, or you can use an online tool, or purchase an ovulation testing kit from your local pharmacy.Make an appointment with a gynae or healthcare professional Many South African gynaecologists will only take care of pregnant women who were already their patients before they fell pregnant. Start asking friends and families to recommend a good gynae and make an appointment for a check-up.Even if you are opting to go with a midwife delivery, it\"s still a good idea to have the all-clear from a specialist in women\"s medicine before you embark on your journey to motherhood.Final word Pregnancy and birth are two of the most special experiences that a woman can go through. By planning and taking care of yourself well in advance of the happy event, you\"ll be giving your baby and yourself the gift of good health."

        "content": "Retrenchment. Surely the word alone is enough to strike fear into anyone\"s heart? Let me set the scene. Rumours start spreading at the office about cut backs and cost cutting. Much conversation and speculation around the water cooler. The HR manager looks like he hasn\"t slept in weeks and your boss is avoiding you. Finally a staff meeting and the official announcement: the company needs to save money and retrenchments are the only option.At one stage or another most of us are going to have to face retrenchment. Managing your career and surviving in a dog-eat-dog world is not about avoiding retrenchment but about making sure that you have the skills, resources and know-how to survive it. Read on to find out how.1. Get protectedSome insurance companies and banks offer salary and retrenchment protection policies that will pay out for a certain period of time if you are ever retrenched, supplementing the pay-out you get from your company and tiding you over until you find another job.Another product available to you is a credit protection policy, which will help you service your debt in case of retrenchment or even illness and disability, depending on the policy.It is certainly worth investigating the various options available to you but remember that nothing beats the protection of savings! To our next point....2. Emergency fundExperts advise that you have at least 6 months worth of living expenses saved for a rainy day. While this might seem like an impossible number remember that even just one month\"s worth will make a difference. Put a set amount into your emergency fund every month until you have reached your target.3. Skill upWe should all have career goals to work towards: a more senior position, a job with a blue-chip company or an outstanding achievement in your chosen field. You should also constantly strive to skill up, be it with a short course, a diploma or even a degree. Stay up to date with news and developments in your chosen field and make sure that you have, or are working towards acquiring, the latest skills and knowledge. Skilling up is about setting your CV apart from the rest and making sure that you are the most desirable candidate for the job.4. Sell yourself and network!  Attend workshops, seminars and events to network and stay in touch with your peers. Follow and participate in industry or professional groups online and become active on LinkedIn. You could even consider contributing to relevant journals or blogs and establishing yourself as a subject matter expert. Get your name out there and get to know the right people their help might be invaluable if you ever need to find a job.Top tips:Do not under any circumstances spend the pension money you get from your employer. Rather reinvest the money immediately and save it for your golden years.Keep your CV and online profiles up to date.Subscribe to job alerts  - keep an eye on what your peers are earning and which companies are hiringFinal wordIf you feel that your company is in trouble or heading towards a dead-end, start looking for a job rather than waiting for the axe to start swinging. Be sensible and proactive and stay one step ahead of your HR manager!  "

        "content": "Personal loans are tempting. All it takes is one phone call and ka-ching, there is money is in your account. Lots of lovely lolly for you to spend on whatever your heart desires. But it is not that simple, is it? Consider that the average South African spends 75% of their take home pay on debt repayments with more and more people defaulting on their payments every month. Find out how you can avoid becoming another statistic with this advice from The Money School\"s Gary Kayle.Can you really afford the loan?  Work out if you can really afford the loan before you contact a credit provider. Carefully consider how much money you have available in your budget after expenses to make your monthly repayments. Make sure that the expenses listed in your budget are realistic and regularly updated think about tracking your expenses for a few months if you are not sure how much you spend on food, petrol etc.When calculating affordability you have to think ahead. Are your expenses going to increase in the next year or two? Is your child starting school next year, for example?Remember that a healthy budget includes retirement savings, regular contributions to an emergency fund and an amount for unexpected monthly expenses.Top tip:  Beware of unscrupulous salesmen who will encourage you to understate your monthly expenses to ensure that you quality for the loan and that he/she earns commission!How much are you actually borrowing? Before you sign on the proverbial dotted line be sure to work out what your total repayments will be, including interest and administration fees. Did you know that providers charge compound interest on personal loans, which means that you pay interest not only on the amount you originally borrowed but on the interest that you accrue as well.A R10 000 loan taken over a period of two years at an interest rate of 25% could end up costing you R15 000! Is the idea of cash in a flash starting to sound less and less desirable?Top tips:It is worth taking the time to shop around for the cheapest loan as different providers will charge you different interest rates and admin fees.Make sure that your provider is NCR accredited. Find out more on their website.Ask your provider if you will incur penalties if you want to pay the loan off soonerFinal word In an ideal world we would not need personal loans but sometimes we simply have to take advantage of the credit on offer. Stick to the guidelines above and you will stay out of hot water. Remember that ideally you should have an emergency fund available to deal with unforeseen expenses. And, if you are taking a loan to buy a new couch or sound system, you are much better off saving towards your purchases. Never forget these wise words: if you cannot afford to save for it you cannot afford to borrow for it!About The Money School  The Money School equips individuals, couples and even their kids with financial education courses, workshops and tools that are geared at non-financial people who simply want to take charge of their financial lives.

        "content": "On the 30th of December Baby L was admitted to ICU with broken ribs, a fractured skull and damage to her kidneys and pancreas. While her mother\"s boyfriend is being charged with attempted murder and child abuse the mother herself faces the same charges because she did nothing to stop the abuse of her child.The case of Baby L has shown that a mother who does nothing while her child is abused is held equally responsible by the law. But this responsibility doesn\"t stop within the four walls of a home. Any person who knows or suspects that a child is being physically or sexually abused has a legal and moral responsibility to report it.It is never acceptable to stand by when a child is being hurt or sexually abused by an adult but reporting abuse can be a daunting process. We\"ve explained some of the steps involved and listed the various institutions that you can turn to for support.Reporting child abuse According to Gita Dennen, the head of department of Community Awareness and Prevention Programmes at Childline Gauteng, child abuse can be reported to statutory bodies including the South African Police Services, Child Welfare or the Department of Social Development.If you are uncertain if abuse is really taking place or you are not sure what steps you should take you can contact Childline for support. They also have referral services that will help you report known or suspected abuse in your area.Once the abuse has been reported, depending on the available evidence, the abuser will be arrested and charged with the crime. He or she may be released on bail to await their court date. If they are found guilty, they may face time in jail.It is important to remember that any person who works with children in an official or medical capacity including doctors, dentists, teachers or occupational therapists has a mandatory obligation to come forward if they know or suspect that there has been physical abuse. Neighbours or friends are not required by law to report physical abuse, but are encouraged to do so, Gita says.In the case of sexual abuse, however, anybody who suspects it is taking place has a mandatory obligation to report it.But, of course, the obligation to report abuse rests predominantly with the parents of the child.Getting a protection order Because violent or unstable people commit abuse, those reporting the abuse may fear for their safety. Under the Domestic Violence Act and the Children\"s Act, it is possible to obtain a Protection Order to prevent the perpetrator of the abuse from gaining access to his or her victim or the person reporting the abuse.Before a Protection Order can be granted, the abuser must first be reported to the police. The order can then be obtained from the Magistrate\"s Court to prevent the abuser from coming within a certain distance of the child, from being alone with the child in a house and, if alternative accommodation cannot be found, from entering a certain space in the house where the child can be safe.Protection orders are great on paper but can be difficult to implement, says Gita. But it\"s important to have one so that if things get worse or if the couple divorces, the order and its contraventions will act as a string of evidence as to why parental rights and responsibilities should be rescinded.She adds that if a person\"s parental rights have been taken away, that doesn\"t free them from the responsibility of paying maintenance, so the non-offending parent need not be concerned with finances at this stage.The signs of child abuse One of the greatest impediments to reporting child abuse is a lack of certainty. However, even if you only suspect that abuse is taking place you have an obligation to report it. According to Childline, these are some of the signs a child will display when they are in a physically or sexually abusive situation:Knowledge of sexual acts that is age-inappropriatePersonality changesEating disorders/changes in eating habitsSelf-mutilationRunning away, rebelliousnessLow self-esteemWithdrawal, depression, suicidal thoughtsOverly eager to pleaseUnexplained bruises welts or burnsReluctance to go home or to schoolWhy child abuse goes unreported There are a number of reasons why a parent might not report known child abuse. Key among these is that physical abusers are often also violent towards the non-offending parent as well, so that person might fear for their own physical safety. A mother may also have battered women syndrome, in which abused women struggle to free themselves from the abusive situation.Another reason that abuse may go unreported is that the mother may be financially dependent on the abuser. If he is arrested or found guilty, he may lose his job, and the family would be in serious financial trouble. For this reason it is important for the financially dependent parent to appeal to family members for their assistance or to try and achieve some sort of financial independence.No matter what the circumstances it is imperative that abuse gets reported, but Gita explains that people who are struggling to do so for either of the mentioned reasons need to be treated with empathy.The only alternative to reporting abuse is for the abuser to be willing to acknowledge fault, go for therapy and be committed to changing. The family should go for group therapy, and the abuser must go for individual therapy as well, says Gita. But abusers are unlikely to be willing to go through with this so it\"s important not to expect or rely on it.Take the first step If you know about or suspect child abuse, it is your obligation to report it to the authorities. If you are uncertain as to how to proceed, contact Childline Gauteng  or Childline South Africa for advice and support. Let Baby L\"s story be a reminder to us all."

        "content": "Are you sending your little one to school for the first time? Sad? Excited? Happy? Worried? Yes, it\"s truly a confusing and stressful time for your child but, most likely, it\"s just as nerve-wracking for you. Before you chew your manicured nails away, take a look at the tips that we\"ve compiled to help you get through this trying time.Connect school and home life Try to connect the home world and the school world by getting to know parents and children who attend the same school - familiar faces make new situations easier to handle. After school, ask your child about their day, but don\"t bombard them.Get into the routine Get yourself and your child into the school routine a week or two before school starts. You\"ll both start getting used to the new bed times, getting up times and eating times and the big change will seem less daunting.Practice separation Leave your child with relatives or friends for the day so you both start getting used to the idea of not seeing each other for extended times.Be positive, even if you have to fake it Act enthusiastic, optimistic and calm. Children pick up on moods very easily so don\"t upset them unnecessarily. Pretending to be happy often results in actually being happy. Fake it until you make it!Ask for help Don\"t feel ashamed to ask for help from relatives or friends, they might be more experienced (and less emotional) in this type of thing. Talk to friends in a similar situation.Plan goodbyes Never prolong goodbyes, never sneak out on your child and never let them see you cry when you\"re saying goodbye. It is also very important to always be on time when picking your child up and dropping them off.Assumption is the mother of all mistakes Never assume that your child is nervous. Separate your feelings toward school from theirs. If you had a bad first day at school you might over-worry and if you had a good day, you might become insensitive to your child\"s fears.Know that this too shall pass It might feel like the separation anxiety will go on forever, but don\"t fret. Children usually adapt very quickly and with all the new distractions at school, they\"ll do just fine.Remember, teachers are experts in their field and your child is in good hands. After dropping your child off, sit back, relax and enjoy some me time, knowing that your child is in good hands. (PS- if necessary, remember to hide the mascara drenched tissues before anyone comes home)"

You do a quick scan for oncoming cars at a stop street and then turn left. As you turn you see a police officer and your heart sinks. He steps into the road, raises his hand and pulls you over because you didn\"t come to a complete stop. You apologise and ask the officer if he\"ll let you off the hook this time. He looks around and then quietly asks you to Buy me lunch\". Problem solved? Not really.Paying a bribe to a police officer may seem like an easy way out of a fine for a traffic offence. But the reality is that bribery is contributing to the widespread corruption in South Africa. If you are asked for a bribe by a police officer it is your legal and ethical duty to refuse to pay it.According to Howard Dembovsky, the national chairperson of the Justice Project South Africa, receiving or paying a bribe is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 30 years or both. He gives the following advice if a police officer requests a bribe:Refuse to pay the bribe Simply do not accept paying a bribe as a solution. If you broke the law and were caught, accept the fine and not the bribe as your punishment. Remain respectful at all times.Do not accept his threats If you have not broken the law and the police officer is just hassling you for a bribe, ask him to write up a fine. It is unlikely that he will do so as it will create a paper trail that will lead back to him. If the harassment continues, the police officer is committing a crime, and you are entitled to phone the police for help.Report the police officer Most police officers who are soliciting bribes will ensure that their badge number and name are not visible. If you can see this identifying information, take it down. It is also worth noting any licence plates or the location of a road block, as these could be used to identify the officer. Don\"t make threats or challenge the officer, however. Simply take note of any identifying information, move on and report it later.Drive to minimise your risk The simplest way to avoid being asked for a bribe is to avoid being stopped by traffic officers in the first place. If you are obeying the rules of the road and your licence disk is up to date, the chances of getting pulled over are reduced.You can get actively involved in reducing the corruption in our country by refusing to pay bribes, says Dembovsky. If there\"s no supply, the demand will diminish.Play your part in reducing corruption by staying on the right side of the law and the road."

        "content": "You\"ve been dating for a while, you have a lot in common and you are happy together. You think that maybe, just maybe, he might be the one. How can you be sure that you really are right for each other?Successful relationships should be about mutual respect, support and affection. In the early months or years that you are together it can be difficult to objectively assess a relationship because you are so caught up in the romance. We asked clinical psychologist Ruth Ancer for the signs of a healthy relationship.He introduces you to his friends and family and is interested in yours. When two people start building a future together all their relationships become intertwined. You have to become a part of his life, not a well-kept secret. If this hasn\"t happened it indicates a problem.You are included in the big events and the small details of his life. In a committed relationship, at some point, you should become his automatic plus 1 at family and work events and you should also know his brand of toothpaste and when he needs a new pair of shoes. This doesn\"t mean that you have to do every little thing with him, but there shouldn\"t be areas of mystery. Successful relationships are about trust and openness. He respects the things that are important to you. If he is dismissive of your priorities he could turn out to be critical or controlling later.You have similar long-term goals, like when you want to have children or where you want to live. This is very important, because if you are headed in different directions there will be conflict. One of you will have to make significant compromise or you will eventually grow apart.You can communicate openly. You are not afraid to share your feelings and discuss concerns with him.You have good fights. Fighting is important and inevitable. It is how you deal with it that makes or breaks your relationship. You work through conflict with each other in ways that do not do any damage and that bring the conflict to rapid resolution. And you are both willing and able to apologise for your part in the fight.You both feel the same way about your relationship and where it is going. At some point you are going to want to know where your relationship is going. If you feel that the time is right for more commitment you can try asking subtle questions about his future, but if you really need a clear answer then ask him directly.You feel that you are a priority in his life. He must make you feel as though you and your needs are important to him. That is not to say that you are his only priority, just that he should make some of his decisions based on your needs and requirements.You should have compatible values. When the first flush of romance fades and you start building a future together it will be built on your moral and ethical codes. If there is any disagreement in these areas try to consider the impact it will have in the future, for instance, when you have children.You should be compatible sexually. From whether you like to show affection in public right down to how often you enjoy sex you need to feel the same way about what is an essential part of any relationship.You bring out the best in each other and you want the other person to reach their full potential. You are fast becoming the most important person in each other\"s lives. If you don\"t want to help your partner be the best that they can be then the relationship is not healthy.He has disappointed you, but you still respect him. In the early stages of a relationship you assume a lot about the person you are dating. When you learn about his imperfections you should still be committed to the real person behind the projection.Take a careful look at these pointers and measure your own relationship to work out if you are getting what you need or compromising your own happiness as you start to make plans for the future.  And remember that relationships are a two-way street so be sure to give your partner everything you expect from him."

Shouldering the financial load for a family is a task that requires careful planning and a lot of hard work and we salute each and every one of you. To help you get your finances on track this year we drew up this checklist.Medical aid Day-to-day medical expenses and hospital bills should be covered by a medical aid. If you cannot afford a full medical aid opt for a hospital plan only but then be sure to have some savings set aside to cover doctor and dentists bills etc. Remember that without some sort of medical aid and medical savings you will be forced to reach for a credit card to cover medical expenses  - a big no-no.Short-term insuranceWhere would you be without your car or laptop? How would you replace your television or cellphone if they were stolen? Because sometimes the worst does happen you need to insure your vehicles, household contents and portable possessions against fire, theft and damage. Be sure to take full advantage of the benefits that come with most insurance policies, for example emergency roadside assistance. In an uncertain world short-term insurance is about protecting yourself against risk.Retirement planning Don\"t give in to the temptation to sacrifice your retirement savings as you battle to pay a pile of bills every month. Speak to a financial planner about how much you should be saving towards your retirement and where you should invest your hard-earned rands and cents.Top tip: Before you take advice from a financial services provider or advisor ensure that they are registered with the Financial Services Board (FSB). You can contact them on 0800 110 443 to check if your advisor is registered be sure to have their FSP number or ID number on hand.SavingsExperts recommend that you have at least 3 6 months living expenses squirreled away to take care of emergency expenses like car and home repairs. With the savings you need to cover unforeseen expenses you won\"t be tempted to reach for your credit card or take out a personal loan. Your emergency fund should also protect against loss of income due to retrenchment.You should also be saving towards short-term savings goals like a new couch, your next holiday or winter clothes for the kids.Life insuranceAs your family\"s primary breadwinner you cannot overlook life insurance. In the event of your untimely death your life insurance policy will pay out, giving your family the funds they need to cover living expenses. You should also consider disability insurance, which will provide financial compensation if you are ever disabled by illness or an accident and unable to work. Last but certainly not least is dread disease cover, which pays out if you ever contract a serious illness like cancer.Top tip: Have you drawn up a will? It could take years to wrap up your estate if you die without a will, leaving your family financially stranded.Final word Perhaps your golden rule this year should be to avoid the debt trap. If you find yourself slipping into the red every month update your budget and cut corners where you can read these savings tips if you need some saving inspiration. Save for big expenses  - do not allow yourself the instant gratification of a credit card purchase. And lastly, don\"t forget to spoil yourself where you can you deserve a little something special."

With January, a month of promise and opportunity, here is a list of the most common beauty mistakes you made in 2013 and how you can avoid them in 2014.Not wearing sunblockSun damage will age you prematurely. If you do one thing for your skin this year make it a daily application of the right sunscreen. Here are the golden rules of buying and applying sunscreen.Wearing too much make-up Let\"s face it there is nothing more unattractive than spikey eyelashes and a thick layer of badly applied base. Use make-up sparingly and buy the best quality make-up products you can afford.Bad habitsHealth risks aside, if anything is going to make you look old before your time it is alcohol and cigarettes. Take charge and do what you need to do to quit smoking this year you can find out more about support programmes here.  And if you must drink, do so in moderation!Poor postureYour mom was right when she told you to stand up straight. A bad posture is not only unattractive, it is also bad for your health. So... shoulders back, stomach in and chest out!Being unkind to your backDitch the large, heavy handbag and replace with a smaller, lighter fashion accessory. Heavy bags place unnecessary strain on your shoulders and can cause back problems and tension headaches.Not drinking enough water You skin needs water to stay hydrated not juice, soda or coffee but water. Put a jug on your desk at work and make sure it is empty at the end of the day. Squeeze a dash of lemon juice into your water to make it more palatable if you\"re battling to get it down.Sleeping on your faceLying on your side or stomach and pushing your face into the pillow can cause sleep wrinkles. The only real way to avoid sleep wrinkles is to train yourself to sleep on your back or invest in a custom pillow.Inappropriate outfitsNever try and squeeze into a skirt or top that is two sizes too small for you. You do not look sexy you look cheap. And remember what they say about mutton dressed up as lamb and ensure that your wardrobe is always age appropriate!SwearingAs frustrating as life might be sometimes, do your very best not to swear. Beauty is grace and class and a foul mouth is not very classy.Marvellous me You are as beautiful as you believe you are. At the heart of every truly beautiful woman lies a strong sense of self worth and a healthy self-esteem. Know and love yourself and teach your children to do the same.For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.Audrey Hepburn"

        "content": "Is the food you eat your medicine or your poison? Does it nourish your body or burden it with fat, sugar and additives? While we all know the dangers of an unhealthy diet we struggle to find the time to prepare the food our bodies need. For too many of us a bag of chips or the nearest fast-food counter is often our only option on a busy day. Sound familiar? The good news is that help is at hand. As busy as modern life can be there are ways to eat healthily in a hurry. Here\"s how.  General guidelines Whether you are sitting down to a three-course meal or eating breakfast on the go, the following guidelines should inform all of your food choices: Stay away from sugar: learn to read food labels and avoid foods that have sugar added to themChoose whole grains over refined carbohydrates: for example whole-wheat bread instead of whiteCut out processed foods: eat food that is as close to its natural state as possible, for example a chicken breast instead of chicken nuggetsEat a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables daily: the rule of thumb is that at least half of what is on your plate should be fruit or vegetables Eat lean meat, chicken and fish: if you want to eat meat choose lean cuts or poultry Eat the right fats: your fat should come from fish, nuts and vegetable oils (for example olive and canola oil) and not from butter, margarine and fatty meatHealthy in a hurry   It is all in the planning: Healthy food requires some thought and planning. Plan your meals for the week on Saturday, draw up a shopping list and get shopping! Coming home to an empty fridge and grocery cupboard with no idea what to cook will, more often than not, end in an unhealthy supper!  A well-stocked kitchen means that you can prepare easy, nutritious meals at any time. Make sure that your pantry and freezer are always well stocked with meat, chicken, frozen vegetables, herbs and spices, rice, pasta, lentils, tinned fish, tinned tomatoes, condiments, garlic, lemons and stock etc.   Bountiful breakfasts: Your mother was right when she said that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Make sure that your breakfasts are quick and easy to prepare. Get up a little earlier so that you have time to sit down and eat your breakfast before you fly out the door. It will give you a chance to gather your thoughts, prepare mentally for the day and digest your food properly!  Some breakfast ideas include: a combination of plain yoghurt, fruit, nuts and muesli, smoothies, hard-boiled eggs, sliced apple with cheese and nuts or even a good old peanut butter sandwich on whole-wheat bread.   Get snacking: Always have a healthy snack on hand and you won\"t be tempted to reach for chocolates and chips. Prepare your snacks for work the previous night and you are ready to go the next morning. Healthy snack ideas include dried and fresh fruit, nuts, homemade popcorn, biltong, raw carrots, whole-grain tortilla chips and whole-wheat crackers. Snacks should be quick and easy to prepare.  Cook in advance: Make sure that you always have a healthy lunch at work: cook a large meal at night and take leftovers to work for lunch the next day. Or, cook a few dishes on a Sunday and freeze portions to eat for lunch and supper during the week.  Have a Plan B If you have no choice but to buy a meal in a hurry make sure that you always have a Plan B. Get to know the healthy take-away food outlets in your neighbourhood or buy a rotisserie chicken and salads from the deli counter at your local supermarket.  Getting it right  Remember the 80/20 rule. Aim to eat nutritious, life-giving food just 80% of the time and you will live a long and healthy life.   \"One should eat to live, not live to eat.\" Moliere _________________________________________________________________________________________________  You might also like....

Sometimes women can be so swamped by taking care of others that we forget to tend to our own basic needs. But we can only look after everyone else if we are the fittest, healthiest, happiest versions of ourselves possible. Here are five ways to make sure you get a little of your own attention.Make time for the things that keep you fit and healthyMake time in your schedule for exercise at least three times a week. Keeping fit is central to your physical and emotional wellbeing but is often neglected in a flurry of other activities. If it is difficult to get away at the same time each day, try to do one evening class, one early morning class and one lunch-break class each week. Put them in your diary and don\"t break the appointment!Nourish yourself by eating healthily and taking your supplements and don\"t forget to schedule regular check-ups with your GP, gynaecologist and dentist etc.Set up some non-negotiable me timeHave an established time, once a week, that is all about you. How you spend that time is up to you. You can see a friend, read a book, take a bath or go shopping. Try and supercharge your me time with a hobby doing something that you really love does wonders for mind, body and soul.Indulge yourself a littleIn addition to your weekly me time, give yourself rewards to look forward to a day at the spa or a night out with friends at a fancy restaurant. It is much easier to go through the daily grind when there is a treat at the end of the tunnel.Ask for helpYou might think that you are responsible for everyone else in your family, but don\"t forget that they are responsible for you too. Let them know that you need their help and ask them for their support. If they don\"t give it, insist. Draw up a schedule and a roster and get them all involved in the running of their lives.Save for yourselfOpen a savings account just for you. Budget to set aside a small amount of money even just a couple of hundred rand each month. Whenever you have a little extra cash, pop it into the account as well. You might not be saving up for anything in particular, but think of it as your rainy day fund. One day, when you really want or need something, you will have the cash to do it.Final wordRemember that you deserve to relax and have fun. Take a break and you will find the strength to keep running the world."

        "content": "In a country where 24% of the population is unemployed and thousands live in poverty, each and every South African should do what they can to give something back to those in need.  With outstretched hands at every robot you need think carefully about how you give of your time or money if you want to make a real difference to the lives of others. This is the game plan you need.Budget for charityLook at your finances, and work out what you can reasonably afford to give each month. Remember that donations to registered welfare organisations are tax deductible. If this is the case, ask them for their tax number and a record of your donation that you can use when you complete your tax return.Identify the causes that you want to supportYou can make a big difference to specific causes by identifying them as your charities and donating a specified amount each month. Every little bit helps, but an ongoing donation that the charity can count on is a gift that keeps on giving, literally.You may care more about orphans or the plight of the aged or homeless people or literacy projects. Whatever your pet cause, try to identify an organisation that does work in that area so that you feel that you are supporting projects close to your heart.You can also ask to see any charity\"s manifesto to make sure that their approach and politics are aligned with yours. And it is always a good idea to do some internet research into the charity\"s work and visit their premises if you can.Find out what the charity needsIf you are looking for ways to help a small local charity, call them up to find out what items they are short of. Most charities have a wish list, and something that you have lying around could just be at the top of their list. Remember that if you donate food, it shouldn\"t be past its sell-by date, and clothes can be worn, but should still be in decent condition.Donate your timeIt may sound trite, but often the donation of your time is the greatest gift of all. You could clean runs for animal charities, groom or exercise pets, teach children to read or even read to the aged.Remember that it\"s also OK to say noPart of being a giver is that it\"s hard to say no. For your own peace of mind, it\"s important to accept that you\"re never going to solve the whole world\"s problems, and the little that you do is enough. Always say no kindly and graciously, and don\"t let yourself feel bad about it. Whatever you give, and whomever you give it to, your caring makes a difference, and 1st for Women salutes you for the work you do to help change the world, one gift at a time.You might also like Sunscreen rules and mythsYour skin is your most valuable asset.

        "content": "A police force tainted by unscrupulous cops makes stopping at roadblocks nerve wracking and sometimes even dangerous. Knowing how to handle the situation can go a long way towards protecting yourself and your family. Howard Dembrovsky, the national chairperson of the Justice Project South Africa, advises the following:Only stop if it\"s safe for you If a roadblock has been set up late at night or in a secluded spot with no other vehicles present, it is advisable for any motorist, but especially females, to use the Blue Light Protocol, says Dembrovsky.The Blue Light Protocol has been proposed by the Justice Project to protect motorists from harassment by police officers. It involves slowing down, putting on your hazards, indicating that the police should follow you, and then driving slowly to the nearest police station or petrol station with CCTV cameras in operation. You can read about the protocol in more detail here. However, Dembrovsky caution that you shouldn\"t use the protocol once you have already stopped and engaged with the police, as this could be seen as resisting arrest.Understand if it\"s an official roadblock There are two different types of roadblocks. The first are informal roadblocks set up at random by the police. The second are K78 roadblocks, which are approved by the provisional commissioner and possibly policed by the traffic police, the South African Police Service and even South African Revenue Services officials.In a K78 roadblock, the police are entitled to search your vehicle and can even go to a full body search if they have reason to suspect that you are hiding something. You can ask to see the authorisation proving that the roadblock is legitimate, but this does escalate the situation immediately, and our experience has shown that the situation can get nasty fast.Simply put, it is better to comply than to resist whether it is an unofficial or official roadblock.Dealing with outstanding traffic fines  According to Dembrovsky, there is no provision in South African law that allows for the police to set up roadblocks and demand that you pay your outstanding fines. There is only a provision for a warrant to be issued for your arrest if you do not appear in court for a criminal summons, which can also be extended to the non-payment of traffic fines, but police at a roadblock would not have these warrants on their person.Regardless, the South African police persist in establishing illegal roadblocks that use license plate recognition to check whether you have any outstanding fines. While the process itself may be illegal, if the fine is legitimate, the best way to deal with this situation is simply to pay what\"s owed.Accept a breathalyzer test If a testing point for drunk driving has been set up, Dembrovsky says that you aren\"t legally obliged to agree to a breathalyzer, but that you should. This is because if you don\"t comply, the police have grounds to arrest you and perform a blood test.In South Africa, the legal limit for breath alcohol is 0.24mg per 1 000ml or a blood alcohol limit of 0.05g per 100ml. The police will sometimes exchange one limit for another to persuade you that you are over the limit after you\"ve been breathalysed, says Dembrovsky.For this reason, he advises all South Africans who intend to drive to avoid alcohol altogether. In this way, there can be no dispute about whether or not you are over the limit, he says.The Justice Project The Justice Project offers a wide range of legal and supportive services to the public and other organisations.

Your annual holiday might be a great time to de-stress and unwind, but that doesn\"t give you permission to abandon your exercise schedule and overindulge on festive season treats.Take note of these five tips and say hello to 2014 feeling refreshed and revitalised.Holiday exercise schedulesIf you exercise regularly when you are at home make time to do the same while you are on leave. Many holiday towns offer seasonal yoga or Pilates courses, for example. If your holiday destination doesn\"t offer any workouts, beaches or the countryside are great places to go for a run.  You can also choose active outings so that exercise feels like fun. Try hiking, beach walks, volleyball or skiing (if you are not in sunny South Africa).Don\"t make your exercise schedule so demanding that you won\"t stick to it. Rather aim for achievable goals, like making sure you take a brisk 20-minute walk at least every second day.And if you know that one of your New Year\"s resolutions is going to be start exercising give yourself a two-week head start during your break.Eat carefullyIndulgence is one of the perks of being on holiday, right? Wrong! It is not a perk if it leaves you with unwanted kilograms and regrets for the rest of the year. Again, it\"s important to make allowances because you\"re on holiday, but also make space for healthy food.When you go shopping, don\"t only stock up on salty, greasy, sugary snacks. Rather buy fresh fruits, fresh vegetables and low-fat dips, and eat those when you are peckish.If you are going to be out for the day, pack a light lunch to take with you rather than being tempted by fast-food outlets.Lastly, practice portion control dish up small amounts, eat slowly and stop eating when you are satisfied, not full. Try to make sure that vegetables make up half your plate.Avoid the alcoholOne glass of wine has the same amount of calories as a packet of chips. Abusing alcohol also damages your liver and can contribute to your risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Moderate drinking classified as one unit of alcohol per day for women is fine, but you can\"t save up your units and have one big binge on New Year\"s Eve!To drink responsibly, always drink water first, alternate alcoholic drinks with non-alcoholic drinks, and drink after meals. Exercise also helps to eliminate toxins from your system. And of course, don\"t ever drive over the legal limit.Stay out of the sunMany women view the December holidays as the perfect time to get the perfect tan. Tans are, in fact, a sign of skin damage from exposure to the sun. Sun exposure destroys the elastic and collagen tissue in your skin, ageing you prematurely. It can also cause discolouration and ultimately skin cancer.You can read more about how to keep yourself and your family safe from the sun in this article.Watch your walletYour waistline may expand during the December holidays, but your wallet is likely to come back looking slimmer. Just like every other aspect of staying healthy during the holidays, staying financially fit also requires planning.Before you leave for your holiday, do a careful budget of your income and anticipated expenses like travel, entertainment and accommodation and be realistic! Then set yourself a daily budget and stick to it.Remember if you get a December bonus that you should save a portion and use a portion to pay off debt before blowing it on presents and parties.Final wordRest and relaxation are good for mind, body and soul. Just remember to enjoy everything in moderation and that healthy living is a gift that keeps on giving.Enjoy the break and Happy Holidays!You might also like...Have a merry Xmas... on a budgetFrugal is the new festive.

        "content": "One afternoon at work Sandra got a call from a bank. Your loan has been approved and the funds will be in your account in 24 hours, a teller announced cheerfully. Loan? she said, I have not applied for a loan? Puzzled silence on the other end of the line... But you were in the bank this morning filling out the application form, the teller said. No, Sandra was not at the bank, but a fraudster with an old ID book of hers was a book she lost at least 5 years before. When someone steals your personal or financial information and uses it to apply for loans, make transactions on your bank account or defraud your insurance and medical aid it is called identity theft. In Sandra\"s case a woman replaced the photo in her ID book with her own and used it to apply for bank loans and cell phone contracts. Fraudsters, however, have many ways of stealing personal information that are far more ingenious than just getting their hands on lost identity documents. From the most basic to the hi-tech, they have been known to sift through dustbins, steal information that they have access to at work, hack into computers or even use spyware.How do you know if you have been a victim of identity theft? Like Sandra, you might get calls from banks or other institutions about loans that you know nothing about, or you could receive statements for accounts that have been opened in your name. Money might be taken out of your bank account or a credit application might be turned down because you have a bad\" credit record thanks to the person impersonating you horror of horrors.Sandra\"s story is just one of thousands in South Africa with more and more people falling victim to identity thieves. Here\"s how you can stay one step ahead of the bad guys:Monitor your credit report for any suspicious activity visit the Experian or TransUnion websites for information on how you can keep and eye on your reportKeep your ID book, passport and any other personal documents in a safe place at home or work preferably behind lock and key!Be mindful of what you throw away  - shred or tear up any documents that might contain sensitive information, for example bank or account statementsDo not carry identity documents with you unless strictly necessaryNever give out personal details on the phone how do you know that friendly call centre agent is really calling from your bank?Selling your computer or cell phone? Make sure you have deleted any personal informationBe wary of disclosing personal information electronically  - whether it is on your Facebook page or a registration formWatch out for phishing for example you might get an e-mail from a fraudster masquerading as your bank asking you to share information on a fake webpageIf the worst happens and somebody steals your identity contact the South African Fraud Prevention Services on 0860 101 248 for advice and information on what to do next.Final word:Sandra\"s story has a happy ending. All the fraudulent accounts in her name were closed and her credit record was not affected. She is one of the luck ones. Identity theft is a very real threat  - do everything you can to protect your personal information or, one day, you might just get a call at work..."

Women\"s groups estimate that a woman is raped every 26 seconds in this country, while the South African Police Services estimate that a woman is raped every 36 seconds. Either way, a chilling statistic, and one that only begins to paint a picture of the violent crimes committed against women and children in our country every day. No country in the world is in greater need of intervention to prevent gender-based violence.Every year, countries around the world participate in the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children. In South Africa during this time our government, civil society organisations and the business sector work together to make people aware of the impact of violence on women and children, and to act against abuse. The campaign is far reaching and is discussed at the highest levels of government and business, but every individual in the country can take part in raising awareness and making a difference. Here are some of the ways that you can get involved.Wear a white ribbon A white ribbon is a symbol of peace. By wearing one you stand in solidarity with abused women and children and with those fighting for their cause. 16 Days of Activism is about raising awareness so this simple act goes a long way to showing that you support the campaign.Volunteer at an NGO  There are many organisations that support abused women and children. Do an internet search for abused women shelters in your area and you should get results or look at the list of charities supported by Sisters with Blisters for more ideas on organisations to support.  Phone the different organisations and find out how you can help.If you would like to get involved in the longer term you can look into the counseling courses offered by organisations like Life Line and then volunteer at their call centres.You can also get involved in community policing forums, which aim to prevent crime by opening up the lines of communication and planning between the police and the local community.Donate money to worthy causes Any donation no matter how small makes a difference to these organisations. Or you can make a contribution to the Foundation for Human Rights, which takes donations during the 16 Days campaign and distributes it to various non-governmental organisations. You can call 011 339 5560/1/2/3/4/5 to contribute.Speak out against woman and child abuse The simplest act is sometimes the hardest. Encourage victims to talk about abuse and to get help. Report child abuse to the police you have to get involved, no matter what the circumstances. Help your sons to understand right from wrong and discuss abuse with them.You can call the Stop Gender Based Violence helpline on 0800 150 150 or visit the People Opposing Women Abuse website for help or information.Final word  Positive results from this global campaign are sorely needed in South Africa. By playing a part no matter how small you can help to make a difference to a crime that touches us all."

It is also not about having one too many and flirting with the guy from accounts! You should see your year-end bash as a chance to network and make a winning impression on colleagues and managers. We spoke to Courtenay Carey at Johannesburg\"s School of Etiquette about the dos and don\"ts of office parties.  Arrivals and departuresAim to arrive no more than 10 minutes after the stipulated time and make sure that you leave before the last guests. The rule is never to be the first to arrive or the last to leave.Cell phone rules  Out of sight is out of mind. Put your phone on silent and stash it safely in your handbag.  Texting or chatting on your cell phone at any social function is just plain rude, as tempting as it might be sometimes.Network up a stormYour boss should be one of the first people that you greet. Chat briefly and thank him/her for the evening and then move around the room and talk to as many of your colleagues as possible. Don\"t keep to yourself or huddle in a corner with your work mates.  Remember that alcohol does loosen the tongue so steer clear of office gossip and sharing too much detail about your personal life. Lastly, it goes without saying that flirting and romantic hook-ups are a no-no. The devil is in the drinks  Getting drunk at an office party is not only embarrassing but it could also do some damage to your chances of advancement and promotion. Try to eat before you start drinking and be sure to drink a glass of water between each alcoholic drink. Know your limits and stick to them!Chances are that you will drink more than you are legally allowed to so catch a taxi home or ask friends or family to fetch you.Fiddling with finger food  Trying to hold on to your handbag, sip a glass of wine and eat a sausage roll is more than a little challenging and not very elegant. Courtenay shared this great tip: keep your right hand free to eat and sip at your drink by putting your glass on your plate. If you are drinking wine you can even anchor the glass by holding down the base with your thumb. Carry a bag that you can sling comfortably over your shoulder.Final Word Don\"t be the butt of office jokes the morning after the party. Stay sober, smile and get networking!Designated Driver As a 1st for Women policyholder, you can add Designated Driver Assist to your car, home or building insurance policies. Once you have signed up you can call on the services of two professional drivers to transport you and your car to the destination of your choice if you have had one drink too many and don\"t want to drive.About The School of EtiquetteThe School of Etiquette offers Corporate and Social Etiquette as well as International Protocol training.

        "content": "Your boyfriend says he got stuck at the office, but something tells you he is not being completely honest. A colleague swears she left your coffee mug on your desk, but you do not believe her for a second. Your son says of course he has finished his homework, but you suspect there is a little something he has conveniently forgotten. Most people already have an innate sense of when they are being lied to. With these five insights into body language you can start turning sense into certainty.Body language is a serious study and some specialists in this field even help with police investigations. Others become entertainment mentalists and amaze audience members when they read their minds\". In reality they are looking out for the subtle signs or tells\" that show the experienced eye when we are not being truthful. So what are the signs that you should look out for if you think someone is lying to you?They touch their nose and mouth a lot When people lie adrenalin rushes to their noses, causing an imperceptible swelling of the capillaries. This is called the Pinocchio effect\" and it causes itchiness, so fibbers rub their noses while they are speaking.Another theory suggests that liars cover their mouths to prevent the lie from escaping. Children in particular try to cover their mouths when lying.It is in the eyes Liars try to appear as if they are telling the truth by using the appropriate facial expression. People who are genuinely happy or sad use their whole face to smile or frown. Liars only use their mouth. If a facial expression does not extend from the mouth up the cheeks and to the eyes, chances are it is not genuine.Contrary to what many people think, liars do make eye contact. In fact, they make too much eye contact. People who are telling the truth may look around to help them think, or get distracted by objects. Liars fix their gaze on you in an attempt to appear to be honest. Looking to one side while you are speaking is also not necessarily an indication of lying.Other eye tells are frequent or longer-than-usual blinking.Watch out for sweating Measuring sweat is actually one of the ways that a polygraph assesses whether criminals are lying. While these machines are sensitive enough to pick up minute changes in skin moisture, you can look out for visible signs of sweating and become a human polygraph. Just remember to take the weather into account before you make any accusations!Follow their fidgeting Fidgeting is a sign of nervous energy. Liars often play with objects, their clothes, their own hands or anything else that they can get hold of to distract themselves from the words coming out of their mouth.Just remember that fidgeting is a sign of any kind of nervous energy. If the person is shy or uncomfortable, it\"s not necessarily a sign that they are lying.Their bodies are stiff When people are conversing naturally, their arms, legs and heads are relaxed. People who are lying will appear stiffer. They might also tip their bodies away from you, rather than towards you. Their responses might also be slower and stilted rather than natural and flowing because they are taking the time to think of an appropriate response.Final words  These are just some of the tells that can indicate to a listener that a person might be lying. By becoming sensitive to these signs you can become a more astute judge of character. But remember, for putting on a show or hunting down the office thief, lie detection is best left to the professionals!"

Left untreated diabetes can cause heart attacks, strokes and even kidney disease... and these are just the start of a long list of life-threatening complications.As frightening as the condition might sound, the good news is that Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, is preventable. Yes, by making the right lifestyle choices, from exercise to diet, you can keep the silent killer at bay. With World Diabetes Day observed on the 14 November we answer your questions about diabetes. Remember, knowledge is power!What is diabetes? Diabetes occurs when the body stops producing sufficient insulin to process the sugar in our diets, resulting in dangerously high blood glucose levels. There are two types of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, the pancreas simply stops producing insulin.

It\"s important to remember that you may have Type 2 diabetes with no symptoms at all.

        "content": "Not many South Africans would feel comfortable pulling over to the side of the road at night at the request of a car flashing blue lights. At the same time we know that ignoring the instructions of a police officer is an offence. Where does that leave you, driving home alone at night with blue lights flashing in your rear mirror? What do you do to stay on the right side of the law and protect yourself against criminals? Here is your answer. The Road Traffic Management Corporation and Justice Project South Africa have developed a protocol to be followed by any person who feels uncomfortable stopping for vehicles with flashing blue lights\".The Road Traffic Management Corporation and Justice Project South Africa: Blue light protocol Motorists are advised to study this advisory carefully and to commit the procedures to memory.  If you follow the instructions to a tee there should be no reason for you to become endangered by either legitimate or bogus police. If you are followed by a vehicle, marked or not, with blue flashing lights and it indicates for you to pull over, particularly at night, you would be wise not to do so if you feel uneasy or unsure that they are genuine police.  Instead, it may be wise for you to indicate that you wish to proceed to a police station or public place before stopping. However you must bear in mind that not stopping for genuine police can immediately escalate the situation and may endanger you further if you do not take extreme care to abide by ALL OF the rules laid down here.When indicating to the occupant/s of the vehicle following you that you wish to have them follow you to a place of safety do the following:1. Stay calm2. Slow right down and turn your hazard lights on and then:Extend your right arm out of the window with an tightly outspread hand extended into the air with your forearm at 90 degrees to your shoulderGesture for them to follow you by moving your forearm forward and back to the upright, and repeat this action several timesDrive at NO MORE THAN 40km/h and proceed DIRECTLY to the CLOSEST police station or public place with CCTV cameras in operation, like a service station forecourtDO NOT drive to your own, or a friend of yours\" home, as this may endanger you and your loved ones if those following you are not genuine police3.Go to a police station If you have a cell phone with you, call 10111 and tell them that you are being followed and are proceeding to the closest police station or public placeIf you are not sure where the closest police station is you can ask the 10111 operatorIf possible provide the registration number of the vehicle that is following you so it may be established if it is a legitimate police vehicle or notIf you go to a police station, when you get there and if there are no police personnel in sight outside, hoot for as long as it takes for someone to come outRemain in your vehicle with the engine running, in gear and your windows wound up until such time as police from the station come out to youCooperate fully with police personnel from that police station and the officers from the vehicle that followed you and explain immediately that you felt intimidated and therefore proceeded directly to the police station4.Go to a service station If you go to a service station, drive onto the forecourt (centre of the service station) where the pumps or the convenience shop are so you will be in full view of the camerasCooperate fully with the officers from the vehicle that followed you and explain immediately that you felt intimidated and therefore proceeded directly to the service stationNo matter what, if you are shouted at, do not respond by shouting back.  Also be careful not to respond to any potentially violent acts by resisting in any way or becoming violent yourself.  Remain calm and respectful and explain that the reason you did not stop immediately was because you were not comfortable that they were genuine police.There is a massive difference between evading, or fleeing from police and having them follow you to a place of safety.Both members of the public and genuine police should feel comfortable with this protocol, since it offers protection from attack in an isolated place by moving the stop to a public place where witnesses and assistance should be around.WARNING: If you follow ALL of these steps precisely and the people pursuing you start shooting at you do everything that you can to evade them and get away without endangering yourself and others.  Phone police immediately.  Disclaimer: This protocol is released as is in the public interest and neither JPSA nor the RTMC can accept any liability whatsoever for any deviation from it by any person.Source: Justice Project South Africa  "

        "content": "October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month with the iconic pink ribbon splashed across magazines and the internet. As you read the survivor stories and dutifully study lists of symptoms, it is important to remember that certain women are more at risk of contracting breast cancer than others. Are you one of those women? Understand your personal risk factors for developing breast cancer and how you can fight back against the disease. We spoke to Dr Sarah Rayne at the Netcare Breast Care Centre of Excellence.Age and family historyThe two factors that put you at greatest risk of developing breast cancer are age and a family history of the disease.If you have a family history of breast cancer it is a good idea to discuss with a GP and ultimately a specialist how often you should have a check-up, says Dr Rayne. A rule of thumb is that you should start going for mammograms when you are ten years younger than the youngest age at which someone else in your family developed breast cancer. Estrogen exposureOne of the biggest contributors to your risk of breast cancer is your exposure to estrogen in your lifetime. Dr Rayne explains that the following factors will increase your exposure:Starting your period early in life and finishing it later than the average womanTaking hormone replacement therapy for menopauseObesity, as one of the places that estrogen is created is in your body fatThere are, however, also certain factors that decrease estrogen levels:Having children before you turn 30Having more than five childrenExtended breastfeedingWhile we do not have control over many of these factors it is nonetheless helpful to be aware of them so that you can let your healthcare provider know when the time comes for breast exams and developing your own personalised examination plan. Dr Rayne does note, however, that it is best to avoid hormone replacement therapy unless you are really struggling with the symptoms of menopause and your doctor agrees that you are fortunate enough to have a low-risk profile.Alcohol and exercise The final two factors that increase your risks of breast cancer are: Increased alcohol consumptionLack of exerciseThese are two risk factors that you do have control over so ditch your next glass of wine for a workout at the gym! Fight back: regular breast exams and check-upsAll women should examine their breasts once a month, at the same time of the month, so that they become familiar with the feeling of their breast tissue at that point in their hormonal cycle.If you don\"t have any of the risk factors we outlined above then you only need to start going for regular breast exams when you turn 40. This means you should have a medical professional examine your breasts for you every six months and a mammogram at least once every two years. After 50, you should go for a mammogram every year.If you believe that you might be at a higher risk of developing breast cancer you should see a specialist to develop a personalised examination plan. But remember that often breast cancer appears in women with no specific risk factors and this is why regular self-examination is so important.Any questions?If you are concerned about breast cancer, or have any questions, you can get in touch with Dr Rayne by visiting the Netcare Breast Care Unit website, and clicking on the Ask Dr Sarah button. She also holds a breast examination clinic for patients who are not on medical aid on Wednesdays at the Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg. "

        "description": "",
        "content": "Buying a second-hand car can be a daunting task. You want a reliable car at the best possible price but where do you start? How do you even begin to negotiate the notoriously troubled waters of second-hand car purchases? Here are eight tips to help you find the pre-loved car of your dreams.Work out what you can affordUse one of the nifty calculators available online to work out how much you can afford to spend on your new baby. We like the Carfin and AutoJunction calculators.If this is your first car remember that the total cost of ownership also includ es insurance, repairs and petrol costs. Most importantly, be realistic about what you can afford and the impact it will have on your finances!Decide on what type of car you needThink about your lifestyle and what you will use your new\" car for. If you visit family in the countryside over the weekends, then go for something more rugged. If you spend a lot of time driving around in the heat of the day, make sure that you get air-conditioning. And if you are planning to have kids sometime soon then buy a four-door car with plenty of boot space and great safety features! If you are not sure what type of car you want, spend a few weekends test driving a few options in your price range.Find a reputable dealer Here is the golden rule: buy from a reputable dealer. But how do you know if a dealer is on the straight and narrow? A good place to start is to visit the RMI or Independent Dealer Association websites and search for a dealer in your area. Buying from a dealer that is registered with either of these associations means that they will step in to help you if you have a dispute with that dealer.Car shopping for prosYou might love the colour but remember that beauty is only skin deep. Request a full service history and ask if the car has ever been in an accident. Don\"t forget to consider mileage. The average car does around 30 000km per year, so if a car has done more than that each year you know it has been worked hard!Once you have found a car you like, phone a few of dealers to check the price against the same make of car with similar mileage. Shopping around is important if you want to get the best possible deal.Get financedSome car dealers will process car finance for you, while others will require you to apply through your bank. Beware of residual or balloon payments, which mean you will pay less back on your loan each month but will have a large lump sum to settle at the end of your loan term.Remember that you will need a copy of your ID, proof of residence, a salary slip and three months\" bank statements to get the ball rolling. You will also need a clean credit rating so run a free credit check through a company like Experian or TransUnion.Look after your purchaseCars need maintenance and maintenance doesn\"t come cheap. If possible buy a service and maintenance plan for your car. If you do not have a service plan be sure to save a certain amount of money every month towards your next service.Go easy on the accessoriesIf you\"re budget conscious spend your money on the accessories that you really need and not on kitting out your car with all the bells and whistles like mag wheels, a sound system or a sports kit. Add-ons that might be useful to you are air-conditioning, smash and grab protection for your windows or a tracking system.Get insuredUnfortunately theft and accidental damage to cars are a reality. If the worst ever happens the costs of replacing or repairing your car should be the least of your worries. You\"ve spent a lot of money on your new wheels so look for a good car insurance deal from a company you can trust."

Now, with only two months to go, you are wondering how on earth you are going to buy presents for friends and family and host sumptuous Christmas lunches. The good news is that this Christmas frugal is in and extravagant spending so very last year. Here\"s how South Africans are making Christmas affordable and still having fun. Change your attitudeChristmas is about well-deserved holidays, spending precious time with the people you love and enjoying our wonderful South African summer. It is not about expensive gifts and who made the best Christmas dinner. Remember the spirit of Christmas and you have won half the battle.PresentsHere are a few ideas for cutting down on the cost of presents: Chat to friends and family and agree to only buy presents for children.Plan a Secret Santa so that family members only have to buy a gift for one person.Make homemade gifts: there are literally hundreds of ideas for homemade gifts online.Give gifts of service: paint a room for gran or give a busy mom a break and babysit the kids for a weekend.If you do decide to buy presents for the whole family set a reasonable price limit on the gifts.ShoppingThe rules are simple. Before you hit the malls decide who you are going to buy presents for and how much you are going to spend. Resist the temptation to buy gifts on impulse or to overspend. Do not take your credit cards with you when you shop and don\"t buy anything on your store cards. And remember to give yourself plenty of time to buy your gifts it is those desperate last minute buys that always seem to get you in trouble. Festive foodAsk each family member to contribute a dish to the Christmas lunch or dinner. Not only does this save money it also saves the hostess hours in a hot kitchen! Final wordPlan and spend carefully this Christmas and avoid the January money blues. What better way to leap into 2014? \"Christmas doesn\"t come from a store, maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more....\" Dr. Seuss, How the Grinch Stole Christmas "

Sticking to an exercise routine seems almost impossible when just the thought of changing into your gym clothes is enough to send you straight back to the couch and that cup of hot chocolate you were planning. Dare to be different this winter and exercise your way to summer. Here\"s how. Stay motivated The key to success lies in keeping yourself motivated. Write down your goals for your winter fitness plan and remind yourself of them when the going gets tough. Maybe you want to run a half marathon in summer or even just fit into your summer wardrobe when the weather warms up without having to invest in a new pair of jeans!  Another good way to stay motivated and ready for action is to remind yourself of the benefits of exercise, from the obvious health benefits to maintaining a toned and lean body and of course keeping those winter blues at bay. Exercise also gets the blood pumping and will warm you up faster than that high calorie mug of hot chocolate you were planning! And don\"t forget to reward yourself for sticking to your routine. Whether it is a new winter jacket, a weekend away or a giant slice of carrot cake, working towards a reward is a sure-fire way to keep yourself on your toes.  Lastly, consider working out with an exercise buddy for the winter months. Exercising with a friend is more fun and it is harder to make excuses when there is somebody waiting for you at the gym!   Get organised  A successful winter exercise plan needs to be carefully organised:Where: some experts recommend exercising from home in the winter months How: consider shaking up your routine and finding a new way to exercise, for example a dance class or martial arts When:  draw up a realistic routine that accommodates family and work and stick to it!Remember that nobody is perfect! Don\"t let a few missed sessions derail you. Keep reminding yourself of your goals and keep exercising!Beyond exercise And a final world of adviceâ€¦ Remember that good health it not just about exercise, it is also about your diet, how you manage stress and regular medical check-ups!

        "content": "None of us are strangers to the world of loans and credit but the hard and fast reality is that millions of South Africans are struggling to keep up with their monthly debt repayments. Are you one of those South Africans, dodging calls from angry creditors and dangerously close to being blacklisted? If so then never fear there is a way to escape the debt trap. Ian Wason at DebtBusters gave us these steps to financial recovery.Income and expensesSit down and work out a realistic monthly budget. You know the drill food, rent or bond repayments, transport costs, insurance etc. Now get out your pruning shears and cut back on your monthly expenses:How about cancelling your satellite TV subscription or your gym membership? Can you really afford a maid? Read our money saving tips for more ideas. If you have a bond speak to your bank about restructuring your loan and reducing your monthly repayment. Renegotiate your car and household insurance premiums with your insurance company.  If you have any retirement or other long-term savings plans put them on hold for now and focus on clearing your debt first. Armed with your shiny new budget you should have a clear picture of how much you have available every month to pay your creditors. How much do you owe?Your second step is to work out who you owe money to and how much you owe each of them. The easiest way to do this is to request a free credit report from Experian or Transunion.If your monthly repayments are unmanageable then speak to your creditors and ask them to reduce your monthly instalments. You will find that most of your creditors will be flexible when it comes to negotiating monthly payments that are more affordable for you. Lastly, put a checklist in place to ensure that each of your creditors is paid every month, whether you make your payment in person, via debit order or EFT.Tip: Look at the interest and fees that you are paying each creditor and try to pay off your most expensive debt as quickly as possible.Work it Now it is up to you to stick to your monthly budget and honour your monthly payments. Clearing debt is not easy and there are no quick fixes. It takes patience, focus and commitment to improving your financial well-being.When to get help If you simply cannot afford to repay your creditors despite all your best efforts to reduce expenses and negotiate payment agreements then you need the help of a debt counsellor. He or she will negotiate payment agreements with your creditors on your behalf and help you structure your budget and reduce monthly expenses. Speak to your bank about finding a reputable debt counsellor.About DebtBusters DebtBusters is a debt management company launched in 2008 with services available nationwide.

The guy that stood you up twice or the guy that is stalking you on Facebook. As wonderful as it can be, dating is not easy and you need to have your wits about you if you want to emerge unscathed and even victorious. Here are some words of dating wisdom.Take it slowlyHead over heels in love and convinced he is the one for you? Maybe not. Take the time you need to really get to know him before you start booking wedding venues. Take things slowly and sensibly and you will save yourself a lot of heartache.Don\"t look for perfection There is no such thing as the perfect man, just as there is no such thing as the perfect woman. Be realistic about the men you date that knight in shining armour only exists in fairy tales.Watch out for warning signsDoes he always forget to call? Was he rude to the waitress or just plain drunk? Ignore those red flags and you will pay the price later.Be honestThe rules are simple. Do not pretend to be anything that you are not and be honest about how you feel. Remember that a lasting relationship is not built on a foundation of half-truths and deception.Love takes timeAccept that finding the man that you want to spend the rest of your life with is going to take time. Never compromise and never settle for anything less than the best. Relax, enjoy being single and most important of all enjoy dating!Be realisticIf it is not going to work, it is not going to work. Don\"t go on a second or third date with a man that you don\"t like or are not attracted to. And never date a man that you would not introduce to friends or family.Final wordsIf we have any final words of advice they are these: Do not expect a man or a relationship to make you happy. Love and affection will complete you but they will not make you into the person that you want to be.  First date do\"s and don\"tsDon\"t talk too much about your ex or past relationshipsMind your manners and switch off your cell phoneDon\"t expect him to foot the billArrive on timeStick to a limit of two drinksDress carefully: look good but save those 8-inch heels for another dayBe polite and be interested: talk about more than just yourself!\"Do not just look at your boyfriend as just a boyfriend.

Perhaps it is time to grab the bull by the proverbial horns and ask your boss for that raise. Easier said than done, we know. Whether it is with your partner or boss, talking about money is never easy. If you are trying to work up the nerve to ask for the raise you deserve then here is an action plan. Make a timeDropping hints about the petrol price is not going to get you very far. Schedule a meeting with your boss or supervisor and warn him/her that you want to discuss your salary. A word of caution. If the company is not doing well financially try and hold off on your request until things look up. (If the company is constantly in the red then perhaps it is time to look for a new job!) PrepareYou need to pull together a business case motivating why you deserve to earn more money:Make a list of your achievements in the past year. What have you done exceptionally well? Have you walked the extra mile for your company and colleagues? Make sure that the salary you are asking for is market related and find out what other people in your position are earning. Job ads are a great place to start. Work out how much you think you should earn based on your research and your performance in the last year. Also look at what could possibly be seen as an area you under-delivered in and prepare for that question. Provide unemotional reasons for not completing the task. These reasons would need to be elements beyond your control.The big dayHere are some do\"s and dont\"s for your meeting:Be direct and positive but not threatening. State your case briefly, simply and calmly.Don\"t talk about how much money you need but rather how much you deserve. Always be willing to negotiate. If your request is turned down find out why. In what areas do you need to improve, what do you need to do to earn your raise? Final word Earning promotions and increases is about hard work, dedication and constant efforts to improve your skills. Just as important is true passion for your job. Do your best and you will be rewarded! Do women earn less than men?The answer is yes, according to SARS. For the 2011 tax year women earned on average a taxable income of R160.702. Our male counterparts, however, earned an average taxable income of R223.550.

Find out more about why you need to supercharge your leisure time with a hobby.Why hobby?Stress is a given in today\"s fast-paced world. Hobbies are an antidote to stress, giving us the time we need to unwind and busy ourselves with something that uplifts and enriches us, something far removed from our everyday concerns and routines. Hobbies help us to maintain that essential work life balance, giving us the leisure time we deserve in a life regulated by our careers and home and family responsibilities.Hobbies are about much more than just stress relief. They give us an opportunity to step away from the television and social media and use our free time productively and in a way that gives us true pleasure and satisfaction. Hobbies give us a sense of achievement, are an excellent creative outlet and give us a chance to put our talents to good use or even to discover new talents. For many people hobbies have turned into new careers, an opportunity to spend your working hours doing something you are truly passionate about. Which hobby? Experts recommend that you choose a hobby that challenges you mentally and involves learning new skills. A pastime that involves physical activity is also top of the list. Or, if you find it difficult to get out and meet new people, why not consider a hobby that involves spending time with people who share your passion?My hobby?Keen to start a hobby but don\"t know where to start? List your talents and skills and think about what you enjoy doing and what you are truly passionate about. Here are some ideas to get you started:Music: take singing lessons or learn how to play a musical instrumentGardening: transform your garden into a wonderland or grow your own vegetablesArts and crafts: paint, draw, sculpt, make jewellery, sew or knitDance: from belly to ballroom, the list is endlessIn the kitchen: take cooking classes or bake and decorate beautiful cakesWriting: take a creative writing course and get writing or start your own blogOutdoor: horse riding, mountain climbing or even adventure sportsThe big picture Hobbies are just one piece of the puzzle.

The petrol price is forever on the increase and food certainly isn\"t getting any cheaper.Now  more than ever South Africans need to step up and take control of their  finances. While this might sound like a tall order here are five  no-nonsense steps that you can take to get your finances on the straight  and narrow.  Understand your money personalityIf  you are a credit card junkie or a happy-go-lucky spender who has not  saved a cent for a rainy day then it is time to get to the root of the  problem and understand your money personality. Influenced by your  parents, your peer group, and your value system, your money personality  determines your approach to money and the financial decisions you take.  Taking a moment to understand why you handle your finances the way you  do will help you avoid the same mistakes next time around.BudgetYou  have heard it all before, but without a working budget you are not  going to get very far down the road to financial freedom. Drawing up a  list of monthly expenses is not always as easy as it sounds. You might  need to track your expenses for a few months to get a clear picture of  exactly what you are spending your money on every month. Remember that  every successful budget includes an amount for unplanned expenses.DebtPaying  off your unpaid debt and learning to live well within your means is  crucial. Draw up a plan to pay back what you owe as quickly as possible,  even if it means making sacrifices in other areas. More importantly,  once your debt is repaid, learn to stay away from credit and store  cards!Emergency fundAccording to the  experts we should all have 3 to 6 months worth of living expenses saved in a so-called emergency fund. You should only spend this money in case  of an emergency, for example a sick pet or car repairs. This fund also  guards against financial crises like retrenchment. The great thing about  an emergency fund is that if you have cash on hand you won\"t have to  reach for your credit card when the roof starts leaking or the garage  gate packs up. Don\"t be put off by the 3 to 6 months bit. Even if you  can put away 1 months worth of expenses you are on the right track.SavingsYou  should be saving towards your emergency fund and of course your  retirement. Retirement planning is serious business so call in the help  of an expert. You should also be saving towards your savings goals, like  a much-needed holiday or a new lounge suite."

Saving money on the other hand is a little more challenging. We\"ve put some thought into some practical ways in which to cut down your monthly expenses.Gym membership: The gym isn\"t the only place to exercise. Invest in a secondhand exercise bike and work out at home for free or go jogging with friends.Interest rates and bank charges: Are you getting the best possible interest rate from your bank? Are your monthly bank charges competitive? Try and negotiate a better deal with your bank.  Magazine subscriptions: As much as you might enjoy your monthly magazines, think about cancelling your subscriptions and catching up on your reading online.Electricity: Visit the Eskom website for practical suggestions on how to reduce your electricity consumption. Learning to run an energy efficient household will stand you in good stead for years to come.Buy bulk: Buy your non-perishables in bulk from wholesale outlets, just make sure you have enough space at home to store three months worth of toilet paper!Shop sensibly: Plan your monthly or weekly shopping, draw up a shopping list and stick to it. And remember, never shop with the kids or when you are hungry as you are sure to spend more.Lunchtime: Take a packed lunch to work. It might take some work and planning but it is cheaper and healthier!Satellite TV: This might be a difficult one to swallow but can you see yourself living without satellite TV? If you cannot bring yourself to cancel your subscription completely consider changing to a cheaper package.Downsizing: If you are really struggling to balance the books every month, consider moving into a smaller house or buying a smaller, more fuel efficient car.And lastly, are you still trying to keep up with the Joneses?  Driving the biggest car and living in the biggest house is going to earn you nothing but debt and interest. At the end of the day, saving for your retirement, for your children\"s education and for a rainy day is much more important than the car you drive or the street you live on. Think about it."

Rather it is about who you are and how you behave in the workplace. Try these pointers for size.Be happy This one is simple. Research has proven that happy workers are good workers. Boost your mood by exercising regularly, eating sensibly and getting enough sleep. Make sure that you get the downtime you need and schedule regular vacations. Stressed and burnt-out is not happy.Dress for successNever break this rule. Ensure that you are neatly dressed and well groomed every day of the week. This is important for two reasons. First, people will judge you based on your appearance and second dressing for success will make you feel more confident.Communicate, communicate! Good communication skills are vital. If you feel that yours are not up to scratch then work to improve them. Read books on the subject or take a short course.Gossip alertAs tempting as a good gossip might be, stay away from office gossip and politics. Nobody likes a gossip and even seemingly innocent comments might get you into trouble one day.You need a plan If you want to get ahead at work then you need to know where you are going and how you are going to get there. Speak to your boss about your plans and ask him/her for advice on how you can achieve your goals.Mind your attitude A good attitude is critical. You need to be willing, cheerful and always ready to help where you can. Respect your colleagues and they will respect you.Skill upBe proactive about learning new skills, whether you study outside of work or talk to your boss about how you can skill up at work."

They bring joy and laughter into your life and give you much-needed support in difficult times.Celebrate: Don\"t let birthdays and anniversaries go uncelebrated. Celebrations make people feel special and leave us with memories that money can\"t buy. Small achievements like positive feedback on a work assignment or a new contract should also be toasted.

Recognise and banish negative thoughts. If you are a worrier and struggle to banish anxious thoughts consider yoga or even meditation.Count your blessings: Make a list of all the things that you are grateful for. A gratitude list will enrich and uplift you and help you focus on the positive things in your life. Practice gratitude as often as you can, especially when you are feeling down.Work it: Remember that happiness is a commitment. You will need to work hard to create the life that you want at work and at home. Live with purpose and work towards the goals that you set yourself every day.Your Happiness ProjectMake a decision to bring joy and happiness into your life today. Grab a pen and paper, find a quiet moment and work out what you need to start doing to living a happier life, one small step at a time.

You know all too well the importance of a balanced diet and understand that the eating habits your kids learn as children will be carried through into adulthood. You have read the magazine articles about the dangers of sugar, trans fats and tartrazine and listened patiently to what your paediatrician has to say about early childhood development and nutrition. But, at the same time, you and every other mom out there know how difficult it is to ensure that kids eat all the right foods. Because we understand the challenges you face we have pulled together this practical guide to helping you help your children win the food wars.The battle of the broccoli: helping kids make the right choices!Here are 10 things you can do to lay healthy eating foundations:Keep them interested: serve a variety of different foods every day. Make sure the food looks as good as it tastesInsist on regular mealtimes. Meals should be relaxed and enjoyable a time to bond, laugh and share. No eating in front of the TV!If dinner is running late and they are starving, opt for some baby carrots or tomatoes as a filler instead of a bag of crisps or sugary biscuitEncourage kids to help you prepare food. Children are more likely to eat what they have had a hand in makingBring the kids along when you shop for food. Use the time to educate them about the food you are buying and why it is good for growing bodiesInsist on a healthy breakfast to re-fuel their bodies for the long day ahead. Breakfast should be quick and easy to prepare but no sugar-laden cereal!Pack healthy snacks in their lunch boxesEncourage your children to drink water when they are thirstyTeach children to savour their food and eat slowly and chew properlyDo not ban unhealthy foods outright. Encourage a healthy relationship with food and allow them treats in moderationNever use food as punishment or reward! By associating emotion with food you foster unhealthy eating habitsWalk the talk. Your kids will eat what you eat. Family meal time is a perfect opportunity to lead by example, so eat your veg!Live healthily: it\"s about a lot more than just healthy eating. Exercise together and play togetherWhat\"s for supper?A lot has been written about healthy diets. As a parent it is up to you to educate yourself on what you should and shouldn\"t be feeding your family and how you can do it with limited time and budget. If we have one rule of thumb it is this: avoid processed foods and by doing so keep preservatives, flavourants, trans fats, sugar and all those other no-no ingredients off your menu. Try and feed your family foods that are as close to their natural state as possible. Choose fresh instead of frozen veg or brown rice instead of white. Grill a piece of fish instead of buying fish fingers. And don\"t forget plenty of fruit and vegetables!Final wordThere is no quick fix when it comes to feeding children. It takes time, patience and effort. In our humble opinion, however, there is no greater way to love your children.--------------------------------------------------------------------You might also like...Happy kids?

We have increased consequential loss cover on geyser claims to R20 000 for all new Buildings Insurance policyholders, an increase that will apply to existing policyholders from the date of their annual policy review. And because we know that when your geyser isn\"t bursting or overflowing it is consuming more than a third of your electricity, we asked Eskom for some advice on how you can run a more energy efficient geyser and save on your electricity bill.Electricity tariff increases have hit South African consumers hard. For the savvy consumer, however, there are a number of things that you can do to reduce the amount of electricity that you consume. A good place to start is with your geyser, which accounts for, on average, 39% of your electricity bill. Follow Eskom\"s advice and you can reduce this consumption by 43% (biggest savers listed first):Install aerated shower headsFix all leaking hot water taps. These can waste up to 18 litres of water a day!Insulate your geyser with a geyser blanket and insulate pipes 3 metres before and 3 metres after your geyserTake a shower instead of a bath. Showering uses a lot less water and therefore less electricityTurn your geyser\"s thermostat down to 60%If you are only going to use a small amount of water use cold water and do not let the hot water tap run unnecessarily by using a plug when washingSwitching your geyser off in the morning and back on again at night will not save electricity but it will reduce the load on Eskom\"s power grid and help reduce power outages, especially during peak periods.Make an effort to run an energy efficient geyser and, who knows, your electricity bill might actually go down this winter!Source: Eskom"

        "content": "Crime is a reality for all South Africans. While we cannot live in fear, we must do what we can to keep our homes and our families safe. Have you done everything you can to protect your family?According to the experts, there is no one thing that will make our homes completely safe. The golden rule is to ensure that your home is not a soft target and that you have put as many deterrents in place as you possibly can.  We have divided the security requirements into four lines of defence.Your first line of defence refers to the physical barriers preventing access to your property and should ideally include the following:Your perimeter wall or fence that runs around the property. A good height for your wall or fence is at least six feet high but don\"t get caught out by choosing something decorative that has indentations in it &amp; actually aids a would-be intruder to climb over.Installing electric fencing on top of your wall or fence and having it connected to an alarm system and reputable security company will also make the wall more difficult to climb and your home less of a target.In accessing your own property; electric gates that can be opened via remote control saves you having to exit your vehicle while still in the street.Once you have looked at the external barriers that protect your property, it\"s time to move inside the perimeter wall &amp; have a look at the area that runs from the wall to the house. This area is known as your second line of defence. In this area you want to consider the following:Ensure that outdoor areas are well-lit and well-kept. Overgrown bushes provide hiding-places for would-be attackers. When choosing lighting, opt for sensor lights that come on when there is movement in that area which could alert you if you notice the lights come on. It also saves on electricity and acts as a deterrent to unwanted visitors.Placing external passives outside will provide an early warning system informing you that someone is outside your house. Even if these are only active when you are off the property; the alarm is set-off when the would-be intruders are in your garden &amp; not only when they are already in your house. This will have them under pressure if the clock is already ticking for the arrival of armed response.Dogs can also act as an early warning system but there is always the risk of poisoning. Dogs inside the house where they are safe from poisoning work better than dogs outside.After taking care of your property, you need to concentrate on the house itself and how you would go about preventing access to it. This is your third line of defence. It is important that you have the following in place:We live in a time where burglar bars are no longer an option but an absolute necessity. Installing burglar bars inside your windows as opposed to outside makes it harder to get through this barrier.Security gates on all doors are also a must. Choose a slam-lock version if you can afford to. They\"re easier and faster to close should you need to do so in a hurry.A Safety zone when you\"re asleep. You need to know that when you are sound asleep and despite all the external measures you have put in place; so that if someone still manages to gain access to your home that you are separated from the rest of the house by a physical barrier such as a security gate. The gate should be installed in such a place that it separates the bedrooms from the rest of the house.  The security gate should be covered by a passive &amp; connected to the alarm system.And lastly; your final line of defence comes in the form of a safe room inside your house. This would be a room within your third line of defence where all family members can congregate should attackers be trying to breach your security gate that separates you from the rest of the house.You need to select an area where the family can gather. The master bedroom is usually most suited.This area needs access to your panic button if you have one and a telephone so that you can call for help.A physical barrier like a security gate must separate this room from the rest of the house.If you have made the personal decision to have a defensive weapon like pepper spray or a licensed firearm these should be kept in the safe room and used only if all other lines of defence have been breached.Experts recommend that you put an emergency plan in place to prepare you and your family should an intruder ever gain access to your home. Things you should consider when putting this plan in place:Who are you going to call in the case of a security emergency?Which reputable Security Company are you linked to and what is its estimated response time?Is there an active Community Policing Forum in your area and would it be worthwhile belonging to it?Think about what a criminal is looking for:  Easy access and a fast getaway. Your goal should be to make your home as difficult to get into and out of as you possibly can."

For those of you struggling to find the man of your dreams we have only one piece of advice: be Mrs Right. Gather round all you single ladies to find out more.Looking for love? Start with yourself With a bit of plotting and planning and a dash of daring there is a lot that you can do to find the man of your dreams. Yes, there are tried and tested formulas for finding love (grab a pen and paper because we are going to share some of them with you at the end of this article). The reality is, however, that you will not catch and hold on to the man that you want to spend the rest of your life if you are not leading a happy, well-balanced life.  Think of it this way. Would you settle down with the man who spends 12 hours a day and every weekend at the office? Or with the man who has a drinking problem? Or how about that guy, the one who cannot hold down a job for more than 6 months but always has big plans for starting his own business and striking it rich? Your answer is probably no.  Now shine the light on yourself. Are you the girl that any sensible man would want to spend his life with? Have you found a work-life balance? Do you have hobbies and good friends? Have you dealt with your issues and learnt to be content in a crazy world?Why are these things important? Because they matter to guys looking for partners. And because being happy makes you confident and being confident and comfortable in your own skin makes you beautiful.  Now don\"t get us wrong. Nobody expects you to be Little Miss Sunshine all the time. What we do expect is a measure of sanity and contentment, some progress down the road of life. And of course a little passion and enthusiasm.  So, if you are nursing yet another broken heart or facing another Friday night alone then use that time to do a little self reflection and plan for the future.Every girl needs a plan: finding Mr Right According to the experts, finding Mr Right starts with figuring out exactly who he is. Put pen to paper and detail his personality traits, his likes and dislikes, the type of job he should have and even what he should look like. If you can\"t get that specific on what you do want, rule out the deal-breaker characteristics in your perfect man. Can you not live with a smoker? Is alcohol a turn off? Once you\"ve done that, turn to friends and family for input they probably have some good ideas about what type of man you should be looking for.Once you know who you are looking for you can work out where you will be more likely to find him. Will it be at a rugby match or on the golf course? At an antiques fair or a Harley Davidson club meet? Should you enrol in cooking or kung fu classes? Remember that while this is not an exact science it is about looking for love in the right places!  Now that you have some idea where you should be heading over the weekend you need to get out there and meet as many people as possible. This means sliding off the couch and doing whatever you need to do to feel good about yourself, be it a new hair style or even some new clothes and make-up.Once you have hit the ground running remember that finding love takes time and you might have to deal with a few setbacks along the way. Above all remember that even Mr Right is not perfect just like Mrs Right! \"When you stop trying to find the right man and start becoming the right woman, the right man will find his way to you.\" Cher___________________________________________________________________________________________You might also likeDating mistakes to avoid Whether you are 25 or 45 years old, dating is difficult.

At the same time, however, we need to turn our attention to our finances and insurance policies. Do they need a spring clean as well? This is what you need to know about putting the shine back into your policies.Car insuranceIf you invested in a new sound system or canopy you might need to increase your cover amount. Another point to consider is the people who drive your car on a regular basis. If you are teaching a teenage child to drive, for example, you need to add them to you policy document. If that child is no longer driving your car then remove his/her name as you might be paying a little extra on your premium.Remember to inform your insurer if you changed jobs and are now using your car for work purposes for driving to meetings, perhaps, or to make sales calls.  Home contents and portable possessions insuranceTake stock of all your possessions. If you bought a new TV set or sound system then be sure to update your policy. The same applies if you upgraded your cellphone, invested in a new laptop or if you are sporting a new diamond ring!It is also important to inform your insurer if you upgraded the security on your property as your premiums might decrease. At the same time it is essential to let them know if your electric fence no longer works or if your garage door no longer locks.Buildings InsuranceIf you renovated your home and added a new pool, an extra room or a new roof then contact your insurer. The same would apply to a new boundary wall or front gate.Life insuranceYou need to increase your cover amount if you recently had a child or tied the knot. You also need to review your list of beneficiaries regularly and remove or add names, for example in the case of a divorce, marriage, the birth of a baby etc.Final wordWhy spend the time updating your policies? An out-of-date policy might mean that you are under-insured and won\"t have the cover you need should you ever need to claim.

        "content": "Social media. We all do it. Whether we are tweeting, liking or sharing, most of us are active on a social network every day. With the likes of Facebook central to so much of who you are and what you say it is worth taking a moment to think about your online image. Have you ever considered the importance of protecting your online reputation? What sort of image do you project in cyber space? Get social media savvy and learn the rules of engagement today.Think before you postWe all know somebody who has been left red-faced by a comment made on social media. Whether they were angry, in love, under the influence or just not thinking, inappropriate comments have cost people friends, boyfriends and even their jobs. The rule? Think very carefully before you post. It is important to remember that among your followers and friends you have people from very different backgrounds, religions and countries. What might seem harmless to one person might be deeply offensive to the next.Never post when you are upset or have had too much to drink. If you are not sure about a comment follow your instinct and don\"t post it!Don\"t over shareWhen it comes to social media remember that less is more. Your friends and followers are probably overwhelmed with a constant stream of input on social media networks. If you constantly post, comment, like, tweet and share you will only irritate and bore them. Make one thoughtful post a day instead of five and make it a post that really makes people think or laugh or hit share. Aim to make your friends and followers sit up and take notice.Watch your toneAs with all other forms of electronic communication you need to watch your tone. The reader cannot see the smile on your face, read your body language or hear the sarcasm in your voice. Make good use of emoticons to convey emotion.Be discreetTread lightly when it comes to other people\"s reputations. If you want to comment on a sensitive or private matter don\"t post it on a friend\"s wall - rather send them a message. It also goes without saying that you should never post embarrassing pictures of people online. Lastly, always check with your ex before you change your relationship status.Respond and interactMind your manners. If you post a comment and a friend takes the time to respond always try to acknowledge his/her comment. Don\"t leave people dangling they will eventually just start ignoring your posts.Friend me?Be selective about the friend requests you accept on Facebook and don\"t send friend requests to people you don\"t know - it only makes you look desperate.

Why is assertiveness important?Learning to be assertive will:  Help you to ensure that your needs are met and therefore reduce your stress levels and allow you to take control of your work life and your workloadImprove your communication and management skills and earn you the respect and support you need to get aheadHelp your colleagues to understand what you expect from them and make it easier for them to deliver on your expectationsEmpower you to work with your colleagues to tackle problems and find solutionsBuild your self-confidence and self-esteemCan I learn to be assertive?Yes! Assertiveness is a skill that can be learnt like any other. It just takes focus, commitment and, of course, lots of practice. Where do I start?Rehearse and prepare: If you have to confront somebody plan how and where you will do it. Practice what you want to say beforehand.Control your emotions: As difficult as it might be you need to learn to remain calm and in control in conflict situations. Breathe deeply and speak firmly.Think before you speak: Never lash out or speak in anger. Think carefully about what you want to say and how your words will affect the other person.Accept criticism: Learn to accept criticism without getting defensive or angry. Remember that you too are not perfect!Use I\" statements: For example, instead of saying You always ignore my input\" say I feel like my voice is not heard\". Using you\" statements can make people feel defensiveRemember your body language: Sit up straight and lean forward when talking to people. Maintain eye contact and a neutral facial expression. Keep your hands in your lap.Be respectful and positive: Learn to express negative thoughts carefully and in a way that respects the feelings of the other person. And remember your manners!Start with small challenges: Practice being assertive with a pushy sales person, for example, before you tackle your boss!Learn to say no: Learn to set limits and do what is best for you. Remember practice makes perfect don\"t beat yourself up if you don\"t get it right the first time.Express yourself: Don\"t assume that people know what you want and need. Learn to express your needs clearly and calmly.Final word Remember that learning to be assertive starts with believing in yourself and your ability. You are just as important as everybody else and deserve to be treated with as much respect as your other colleagues."

        "content": "Somebody once said that parenting is one of the toughest jobs in the world and one for which you get the least training. Truer words were never spoken. Raising healthy and happy children in an uncertain world is a demanding and difficult task. Because we know that every parent needs a little help we pulled together a list of our favourite pieces of parenting advice. We trust that they will inspire and guide you! Love your partner Let\"s start with the family unit. An unhappy marriage or partnership does not create the safe and secure environment that children need to thrive. Relationship issues also make you unhappy, which leads us to our next point... Look after your mental health Happy parents make happy kids. It is as simple as that. And remember that your child is very sensitive to your moods. Don\"t make your bad day your kid\"s problem. Nobody is perfect Accept that you will never be the perfect parent and that you will make mistakes. Love your child and do your very best it is good enough. Love them Children need oodles of unconditional love and consistent attention. Show your love for them with actions and words. And don\"t forget physical affection hugs, kisses and all that good stuff.   Discipline them Spare the rod and spoil the child. Discipline teaches children self-control, responsibility and self-discipline. Remember that discipline has to be consistent. The rules are the same every day, no matter how tired you are.Spend time with them Be sure to give your children all the quality time they need. And by quality we mean time when you can really listen and connect... time devoted to nothing else in the world but them. Let them playUnstructured play is essential to your child\"s development. Play teaches children social skills, helps them discover their own unique talents and hones their problem solving skills. It also nurtures creativity and exercises little imaginations. Build their self-esteemThis is so important. If you do one thing for your child you should nurture their self-esteem. It is one of the best tools that you can equip them with to face the challenges of our demanding world. Final wordNobody is born a good mother, divinely equipped with the skills and knowledge she needs to raise children. Don\"t ever be afraid to ask for help.  Read books, chat to friends and attend parenting workshops. The power to be an awesome mother is in your hands!\"We may not be able to prepare the future for our children, but we can at least prepare our children for the future.\"Franklin D. Roosevelt___________________________________________________________________________________________You might also like....What every mom should teach her child Daughters learn a lot from their mothers, sometimes without even realising it.

Are you one of those people who always seem to  be squinting and grimacing in photos, trapped forever in unflattering  poses? If the  camera is your worst enemy then this article is for you.  Read on for our advice on how to look fabulous in photos. Practice Seriously.  Just like everything in life, practice makes perfect. Stand in front of  a mirror and practice until you have found a smile and pose that is  flattering and natural.Another great tip is to look closely at  old pictures of yourself and learn from the mistakes you made. For  example, if your smiles are all teeth then practice smiling with your  mouth closed.Smile secrets This is the  golden rule: your smile has to be genuine. Think of a funny joke or a  happy moment in your life and let the happiness reflect on your face.  And remember to smile with your eyes and not just your mouth. PoseWhile  the secret to a good photograph is to look and feel as relaxed and  happy as possible there are a few poses that you can try to add a bit of  spice to your photos. For example, try turning your body slightly away from the camera, putting one leg in front of the other and resting your  weight on your back leg. You could also try turning your head slightly  away from the  camera.Don\"t forget to relax your body and bring  some movement into your photos - you do not want to come across as too  stiff and rigid. Top tips Learn from the pros and remember these tips next time you stand in front of a camera:Banish double chins: elongate your neck and tilt your chin slightlyDon\"t forget your posture! Stomach in, shoulders back and back straightRelax your face and your smile by putting the tip of your tongue behind your top front teethAdd some mystery! Don\"t look directly at the camera - try focusing your eyes above or to the side of the lensAvoid red eye: the trick is to stare at a light source so that your pupils constrict before your picture is takenFinal words To  look good in photos you have to feel good. Stand tall and proud and  exude confidence. The better you feel the better you will look. Now get  practicing... Taking pictures is savoring life intensely, every hundredth of a second.\"Marc Riboud"

If you are a veteran online dater or just starting out here are some pointers for creating a winning online dating profile as well as our top safety tips.Creating winning profilesThe secret to success lies in your online profile. Put aside some time to craft a profile that not only does you justice but also sets you apart from the thousands of other hopefuls out there. Successful online dating profiles are positive, fun and above all short! Don\"t forget that a potential match has to read through a number of profiles so keep it brief.Your first challenge is going to be your username. First impressions really do count so think long and hard about a catchy and enticing username but make sure that it is easy to understand don\"t be too clever!  When writing your profile think about what makes you special, those personality traits that your friends and family love. At the same time you need to ask yourself the question: why me? Why would a potential match want to date you and not the next person out there? What makes you unique and sets you apart from the rest?  Everything else aside, the golden rule of writing a profile is to be honest about who and what you are. The reality is that even the smallest lies are likely to be discovered at some stage.A picture says a thousand wordsAsk a friend or even a professional to take a few pictures for your profile. Spend time on your make-up and hair but remember that while your pictures should be flattering they should also be as natural and honest as possible.  Experts recommend that you upload more than one photo and make sure that your face is clearly visible in most of them no hiding behind sunglasses. Think about posting a headshot as well as a full body shot. And remember to smile!  Lastly, your photos should be fairly recent. We all looked great in high school but those days have come and gone.Safety first As an online dater your safety should be your first priority:Make sure your username doesn\"t give away your name or surnameAlways drive yourself to meeting places and meet in public placesKnow your limits and stay soberTell a friend where you are going, with whom and when you expect to be back Never share personal information in e-mails, text messages etc.Never share more than your first name until the first dateAlways create a separate e-mail account for your online dating profile/sIf the site requires an address use a PO Box and not your physical address/sFun facts: online dating statistics Girls PreferNice Guys38%Bad Guys15%Blend of Both34%Any man I can get6% Guys PreferThe modern career girl42%The girl next door type34%The hottie24%_____________________________________________________________________________You might also likeHow to get ahead at workLook around the office.

        "description": "",
        "content": "You’ve had a car accident and now you need to submit a car insurance claim. From bumper bashings to 10 car pile-ups on the highway, car accidents are an everyday occurrence on South African roads. If the worst happened and you were involved in a car accident do know what to do at the accident scene so you can file a successful auto claim and stay on the right side of the law? Find out what you need to know and read up on First for Women’s six-step guide about how to deal with a car accident so you can claim against your car insurance policy. Step 1. Pullover and request helpStop your car and pull over to a safe spot off the road if you are able so that you’re not obstructing traffic. Switch on your hazards to warn other vehicles and climb out of your car. If necessary, call for an ambulance or emergency personnel to assist with the injured. If it’s a serious car accident, the traffic police could be called to the scene. Special Note:You are required by law to stop your vehicle if you are involved in an accident and commuters and pedestrians are injured or killed, or if any property is damaged. Failing to stop is considered a criminal offence.[1] You can be criminally charged for failing to help someone who has been hurt in an accident you are involved in, even if the accident was not your fault. Remember, however, that as much as you want to help injured people you should not administer first aid unless you are qualified to do so. Step 2. Clear the road Provided it is safe to do so, move any cars or objects that are obstructing the flow of traffic, but be sure to mark their position on the road first with chalk (or take a photograph) before these vehicles or objects are moved.Special Note:If a person or animal has been injured in the accident do not interfere with the evidence or move any vehicles unless those vehicles are completely obstructing the traffic. Step 3. Assess the damage to the vehicles or propertyIt’s recommended to take multiple photos of the accident from as many different angles as possible for car insurance purposes.  First for Women suggests taking close-up photos of any damage to your car and any other cars involved in the accident. Step 4: Exchanging important information It’s essential that you take down the following information from all other drivers involved in the accident as well as from any people who witnessed the accident: Full names and surnames ID numbersHome, cell and business phone numbersPhysical addresses E-mail addresses Vehicle registration Description of the vehicles (make, model and colour)Names and contact details of the police officials, paramedics and tow truck driversYour location: street name and suburb The time of the accidentRoad conditions and visibility  Remember to take note of what happened immediately before and after the accident, for example, if the other driver appeared to be under the influence of alcohol, or if they were perhaps talking on their cellphone at the time of the accident. Special Note: You need this all information if you want to submit a car insurance claim to your insurance company or the Road Accident Fund or if you want to claim the cost of the repairs to your car from other drivers. Step 5: Report the accident to the police It’s very important, for car insurance purposes, to file a report about the accident to the police within 24 hours. If you are injured or in hospital and cannot report the incident within 24 hours, do so as soon as you possibly can and explain why your report is delayed.Special Note: It is an offence not to report an accident in which another person has been injured or in which someone else\"s property has been damaged even if neither of the parties intends taking legal action.Step 6: Report the accident to First for WomenYou will need to report the details of the car accident to your insurance company in order to submit a car insurance claim.

        "content": "Interested in investing in life insurance? Smart move. A life insurance policy is the financial protection your family needs against the loss of your income in the event of your death. If you are feeling a little unsure about taking the leap into the world of life cover then we have the advice you need. Here are our five golden rules for buying life insurance. Buy from a reputable providerBuy your cover from a reputable broker and/or life insurance company. All financial services providers have to be registered by the Financial Services Board. Contact them on 0800 110 443 to check that your providers are registered with them.Work out how much cover you needCalculating how much cover you need is a job best left to the professionals. Ask your broker or life insurance company to perform what is known as a financial needs analysis. This is a method of calculating how much cover you need by assessing your current assets and liabilities as well as your existing insurance portfolio.  Do not withhold any informationBe scrupulously honest and provide as much detail as you can when answering any questions put to you by your life insurance company or broker. If a provider finds out that you withheld information from them any claims your family makes might be reduced or even rejected. Don\"t withhold information about your smoking or drinking habits, for example, or about your family\"s medical history.  Nominate a beneficiaryBe sure to nominate a beneficiary. If your policy does not have a beneficiary your benefit amount will be paid into your estate and the funds could take years to reach your family. You can nominate more than one beneficiary, for example your spouse or partner and each of your children. You could also nominate your favourite charity as one of your beneficiaries.Read your policy documentsRead your policy documents carefully from start to finish and contact your broker or life insurance company if you have any questions. Take special note of any exclusions, premium increases and waiting periods._________________________________________________________________________________________________You might also like...Great money saving ideasRead these money saving tips if you need help putting a little something away every month.How to get ahead at workGetting the promotion you want is about more than just hard work.

It is the Monday Blues, that lingering feeling of sadness and hopelessness that plagues so many of us on Monday mornings. While there might not be a cure for the blues, there are a number of things that you can do to make your Mondays more bearable.Clear your desk on FridayAccording to the experts, beating the Monday Blues is all in the planning and that planning starts on Friday. Don\"t be tempted to take it easy on a Friday afternoon and let the work pile up for Monday morning. Clear as much as you can off your to-do list so that you\"re ready for any new challenges that Monday might throw at you. Tidy your desk before you leave the office. What better way to start your working week than with a clean, organised surface?Live your weekend!Make the most of your weekend and come Monday morning you will feel rejuvenated with a renewed zest for life. Don\"t be tempted to idle away the hours watching bad TV or mindlessly trawling the malls. Meet up with friends, go to the movies, take a walk in the park or visit an art gallery.  At the same time, make sure that your body and mind get the rest they need to deal with a new working week.Plan for MondayAvoid a mad rush on Monday morning and put some time aside on a Sunday evening to prepare your lunch, lay out your clothes and pack your handbag or briefcase. Check your calendar and make sure you\"re mentally prepared for your day.The big daySet your alarm a little earlier on a Monday morning to make sure you have enough time to get ready calmly and quietly. Pay extra attention to your make-up and clothes, the better you look the better you will feel. Lastly, power your way through the day and make sure that you have a healthy protein-packed breakfast.Happiness is a decisionIf you still cannot shake off the Monday Blues remember that more often than not happiness is a decision. Before you leave the house decide that you will have a positive and happy day. Put a smile on your face, listen to your favourite tunes on the way to work and spread some joy at the office. Make the effort and you will be rewarded with a Monday that beats all others! "

        "content": "Every smoker knows all too well the joy of a cigarette, the joy of lighting up after a meal or with a glass of wine after a long day at work. At the same time they have heard every nightmare story there is about smoking, from the horrors of cancer to the 10 minutes they take off their life every time they light up. This is the tragedy of the smoker, trapped in a habit they know might kill them and yet unable or maybe unwilling to quit. If this sounds familiar and you are that smoker then you need help! With World No Tobacco Day on the 31 May we thought we would take a look at where smokers can go to get the help and support they need if they want to quit. Allen Carr\"s Easyway To Stop Smoking  The Allen Carr Easyway method tackles the smoker\"s psychological addiction to smoking by logically and scientifically removing the smokers desire to smoke while they are still smoking. Once the desire to smoke has been removed (which is essentially the mental addiction), the fear of stopping disappears and the physical withdrawal becomes easy to manage. Allen Carr\"s Easyway method is endorsed by CANSA (The Cancer Association of South Africa).Programme details  Most smokers require 1 five-hour session with smoke breaks throughout.Programme costs R2400 per person or R480 for Discovery Vitality members. Includes a money back guarantee.  For more information go to www.allencarr.co.za or call the national booking line on 0861 100 200.Smokenders  Smokenders is a behaviour modification programme that first teaches smokers to understand and control their habit and then to quit smoking completely.  At the same time, Smokenders teaches participants how to detox and overcome their nicotine addiction without resorting to substitutes or other drugs and without putting on weight. Everyone who teaches the programme has been a smoker and has quit on the course.Programme details  Seven weekly group meetings of around 2 hours each. Correspondence courses with weekly phone in sessions are also available. Programme costs  R2500 per person or R500 for Discovery Vitality members. If you attend seven meetings and do not stop smoking you will be able to take the course again at no additional charge.  For more information go to www.smokenders.co.za or call 011 487 0231.  The Quit Line The Quit Line, operated by the National Council Against Smoking, provides callers with information, tips and advice on how to stop smoking. Intensive telephonic counselling is also provided to smokers who have quit and and need help dealing with withdrawal symptoms. The Quit Line helps smokers understand the importance of quitting as well as identify problem situations when they are most likely to crave cigarettes and find workable solutions for dealing with difficulties. Programme details Telephonic support and information booklets are provided free of charge. Call them on 011 720 3145, Monday to Friday from 8am to 4.30pm (answering service available outside office hours).A final note: If you need just a little more motivation, here are some good reasons why you should quit today:Smoking makes you age faster. No amount of money spent on expensive   face creams is going to be worth it if you continue to smoke.Smoking makes your eyes, teeth &amp; fingers yellowSmoking pushes your medical aid &amp; life insurance premiums up. Smoking adds to your stress levels. Have you ever seen a smoker worrying about her next cigarette?Smoking in public has become such a difficult thing to do therefore becoming an inconvenience.You miss out on the best tables in restaurants!

Make sure you’re a good person to be friends with. Here are a couple of qualities we felt important in a friendship.Be loyal: A true friend will never talk about a friend behind her back and will defend her against unfriendly gossip and rumours.Be dependable: Don’t make promises you can’t keep. If you agree to meet then don’t cancel at the last minute. If you say you will do something, be sure to do it.Be a good listener: A good listener is genuinely interested in what the other person has to say. A good listener also knows that they don’t always have to give advice, sometimes people just need to talk things out.Don’t monopolise conversations: If you are always the one doing the talking it is time to shut up and listen. A good rule of thumb is to talk as much as you listen.Make time: Whether it is an SMS or short e-mail, stay in touch with your friends. Be sure to organise regular get-togethers, even if it is just for a quick cup of coffee.Be supportive: Mom in hospital or relationship blues? If your friend is facing a crisis you need to be there for her.Communicate: As with all relationships, communication is essential. If your friend does something that irritates you, for example, you need to be able to talk about it!Forgive: If you want to develop long lasting friendships you are going to have to be forgiving. And never hold grudges. They will slowly destroy your friendship.Be honest: A good friend has to be honest but not brutal. If her new hairstyle is a shocker you have to tell her, but do it kindly!Have fun together: Friendship is not only about support, it is also about going out and having a good time together. Whether you get together for lunch or a night out you need to be able to have fun together."

        "content": "Premature ageing; two words that are enough to strike fear into the heart of any woman. While wrinkles are a fact of life the reality is that many of the health and lifestyle choices that you make every day might cause you to age prematurely. Shock, horror? Find out how you can protect one of your most valuable assets, your skin. Smoking: One word. Quit. Smoking ages the skin, depriving it of oxygen and essential nutrients. Take a look at the skin of a woman that has smoked for 30 yearsâ€¦ Enough said.Water: Water hydrates your body and skin and flushes out toxins. And when we say water we mean water, not tea, coffee or even fruit juice. Use the Water Wise calculator to calculate your daily requirements.Sun: Sun exposure can cause premature ageing and even skin cancer. The rules are:Wear sunscreen every day, all year round. CANSA recommends a sunscreen with both UVA and UVB protection and an SPF of between 20 to 50 (30 50 for fair skins)If you are hiking or on the beach, for example, reapply sunscreen throughout the day according to the instructions on the bottle. On a normal working day apply it before you leave for work and again before you go out for lunch or travel homeTry to stay out of the sun between 10 am and 3 pm.If you are outdoors wear a hat and UV protective clothes and swimming costumesWear sunglasses with a UV protection rating of UV 400Stay away from sunbeds and sunlampsDiet: Give your body the nutrients it needs to nourish and protect your skin. This means a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist about a good anti-ageing supplement.Sleep: You need to get your beauty sleep but make sure that you are not sleeping wrinkles into your skin by lying on your stomach or your side and pressing your face into the pillow. Train yourself to sleep on your back.Exercise: A regular workout is good for your body, your mind and for your skin. Yes, the good news is that exercise gets your blood pumping, blood that delivers oxygen and nutrients to your skin.Alcohol: If you want to retain your youthful glow, be sure to drink in moderation. Alcohol dehydrates your skin, deprives it of oxygen and nutrients and is one of the causes of those unattractive broken red veins near the surface of your skin.Source: CANSA"

        "content": "Good news! Recent research by The Association for Savings and Investment South Africa (ASISA) has revealed that life insurers paid out 99% of all claims made in 2012. There is bad news however. The majority of those claims that were rejected were given the axe due to non-disclosure by policyholders. The research paints a grim picture: if you withhold information from your life insurance company any claims your dependants make against your policy might be rejected. Find out how you can bullet proof your policy and ensure that your family’s claims are honoured.A 2012 study by ASISA examined the rate at which life insurance claims were paid or rejected last year. Of the 34 724 claims submitted to 12 long-term insurance companies, only 352 were declined. The majority of those claims that were declined were rejected because of non-disclosure, or ‘the deliberate failure of policyholders to disclose information about a medical or lifestyle condition, which is material to the assessment of the risk to be insured.’ Or, to put it simply, they were declined because policyholders withheld information from their insurers and did so deliberately. The study goes on to say that the balance of the claims were rejected due to fraud, underwriting exclusions (when the insured dies as a result of an excluded condition, for example diabetes) or because the insured committed suicide before the standard two year waiting period was over.Make sure your policy pays! What can we learn from the ASISA study and how can we ensure that our policies are squeaky clean?Give honest, detailed answers to all questions asked by your provider including those covering your health and medical history and that of your immediate familyIf you drink or smoke, fess up!Check that the answers you gave to medical and lifestyle questions are correct and review all policy documents that are sent to youIf you take part in dangerous recreational activities or if your occupation involves high-risk activities be sure to tell your insurerBeing completely honest when answering all questions might mean that your premium is loaded or exclusions applied to your policy. This cannot compare, however, to having your family claims rejected!"

Maybe it is just us, but if there is a chocolate bar in the vicinity, we are going to eat that bar as quickly as possible. We certainly wouldn’t carry it around in our handbag for a few days.The research also found that on average, women carry 40 items around inside their handbags.  40 items? We hope they’re all insured! Handbag talk always makes us wonder how men survive without handbags. Where do they put their pens, their sunglasses, their keys and of course that spare pair of underwear? And tissues, how on earth do guys get through a day without a tissue on hand? Do men still use handkerchiefs? Thank goodness for the man bag. Now at least they have somewhere to stash that toilet roll. "

        "content": "As modern women we like to think of ourselves as bold and assertive and not shy to voice our opinions. But there’s one subject it seems, that we dread talking about – yes, the uncomfortable “money” issue.If there’s one thing that’s a relationship breaker this has got be it. Studies have found that over 90% of relationships have ended because couples simply couldn’t agree on how to spend their money. I mean lets face it; no one likes those nasty surprises from the bank at the end of the month because of a careless, impulsive partner.Luckily ladies, you can always deal with this thorny issue before it becomes a sore point in your relationships.Find a Suitable Time: If anything, you should always find a suitable time to talk about the issues that are worrying you. This should ideally be a time where neither of you will feel defensive nor attacked! Avoid all past issues and focus on the here and now.Give a Little to Get a Little: If he doesn’t completely get you and your money concerns. This is the perfect time to voice your concerns and fears. Tell him what you feel and how you best see the situation. If it’s only a temporary situation let it be known and remember, by being as calm as possible your partner will find it easier to confide in you.  Capitalise on your strengths Explain to your partner that managing a budget is tough for most people &amp; explain that you’ve been able to master the art. Offer to take on your joint finances if your relationship is ready for it. If he agrees, remember to be transparent with him. You don’t want him to feel out of control of his own finances.The Third Party:  If all else fails and your partner’s spending sprees are getting you into a financial tangle then it’s time to call in the professionals! There are a number of financial advisers that specialise in this area. Make sure the person is someone you can trust and someone who you both feel comfortable with. "

        "content": "Have you ever considered life insurance?We mean, really considered it? Mostly it seems to be a product that’s intended for the older and more settled generation, but really, it prepares you for any outcome that life’s journey has to offer, and is important to the lives of those you leave behind.That’s why you need to be in for the long haul. Why the long haul? Because when your budget tightens and your wallet gets a little lighter, you’ll look for ways to cut down. More often than not life insurance is one of the first on the list to go.Here’s why you should keep your life insurance:Without it you are left wide open to the range of financial risks from which your life policy was meant to protect you – and your loved ones.Even if your life policy has a savings component, you might not get anything out because life insurance companies must cover all the initial administrative costs, etc.The cost of life insurance is linked to your age so the longer you wait and the older you get before taking out a policy, the more you can expect to pay on your monthly premiums.What effect will this have on your loved ones? Will they have to cover the costs on your outstanding loans and accounts etc? Will it affect their living standards?  You want to know that if something happens to you, those left behind are not financially burdened.In short, this is one area of cover that you shouldn’t risk. If you are desperately looking for ways to cut-back on your monthly expenses rather look for other ways to cut down on your monthly expenses and don’t cancel your life insurance!"

Even though women number less than half of the number of individuals who use, for example, Facebook and Twitter, they are actually recorded as using more of the total time spent on these sites.Surprising? Not really. Our ever-increasing desire to communicate, to connect, and to build relationships will naturally result in a stronger sense of engagement with these sites.Facebook and Twitter are just the beginning, though. Women have also taken to the blogosphere, where they have become a powerful force to be reckoned with. That\"s because women understand how to build relationships and have applied this knowledge to how they connect with their audience. Here they are able to start conversations and as it turns out; these conversations sell!Everyone knows that what women talk about, they sell. Now they have a global audience hanging onto their every word. Word of mouth marketing (WOM) has never been so influential, and the power that women hold in social networking circles is on the increase year on year.Here are some great female-authored blogs to follow:Dawn Jorgensenhttp://theincidentaltourist.tumblr.com/Milisuthando Bongela http://www.missmillib.blogspot.com/Heather Moore http://skinnylaminx.com/blog/Emma Jude http://www.stuffbymissemmajude.com/Tamaryn Watkinshttp://www.exmi.co.za/Kim Kruyshaar and Viv von der Heydenhttp://www.scenicsouth.co.za/"

According to studies done in the past, here are a few indicators:Restaurant spending: Men spend more than womenPetrol purchases: Men spend more on petrol purchasesOnline purchases: Unsurprisingly, women spend more onlineJewellery and large appliances: Women spend more  in this areaIt\"s interesting to see that we seem to conform to gender stereotypes in our credit card usage. For instance, men also lay out for alcohol and hardware, but women hand over their cards more in pharmacies and department stores.We also differ in how we pay off our credit card debts. Women are more inclined to pay the minimum requirement every month than men. More men however put larger lump sums back into their cards. Also, more women than men pay their entire balance at the end of each month resulting in women being a slightly lower credit card risk than men.Just another reason we only insure women!"

Is a pair of boots that are supposed to make you happy really worth the financial stress?Remember that whatever you spend you will end up paying back with interest so even if something was a “must-have” because it was a great bargain you simply couldn’t miss out on; once you calculate the interest, and add it onto the purchase price, you might feel a bit ill realising what you actually paid.If you’ve done the calculation up front however and are comfortable with the repayments, then certainly, make the purchase. This after all is what the credit facility is for. Just make sure you are disciplined in settling your monthly instalments.  A bad credit rating is something really difficult to bounce back from.A credit facility should be seen as an “emergency back-up” and not as a tool to supplement a lifestyle you cannot afford.Two golden rules that will help to keep you out of trouble:"

        "content": "Do blondes really have more fun? That\"s debatable. What does seem to be true is that blondes do have more funds!Recent studies have shown that fair-headed women earn more than women with other hair colours, and that this difference in pay is not connected to other factors - like height, weight or education.Now, before you rush out to lighten your tresses, we have to say that we agree wholeheartedly with Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women, who says that, Having flaunted both blonde and brunette locks, as well as a combination of the two, I have to dispute this research.  South African women have a lot of challenges and issues to deal with when it comes to salary trends and gender equality in the workplace, and hair colour is certainly not one of them. Women still earn less than men and are still under-represented at top management level. There are very few companies who have female representation on their boards, in CEO positions, or as executive managers. Clearly we have bigger things to focus on than hair colour, like cracking the corporate glass ceiling.Let\"s not believe that it\"s what we look like that will help us rise to the top. Rather use Farrell\"s concluding message on the matter:Believe in yourself, don\"t overcompensate because of your sex and be more assertive.  Confidence and self-belief will go a long way to ensure that woman reach the top of the corporate ladder.We couldn\"t have said it better ourselves!"

We\"ve taken his theory to heart and have found some tips that will help keep your toes on your feet if you\"re planning on the doing the Walk in your heels.- Walk with a straight back - as if you were pulling a string from the top of your head.- Clench your tummy muscles by sucking your belly button in toward your spine. This pulls your body weight back onto your heels (and gets in a good abdominal work-out, too).- Steer away from pressure around the balls of your feet by walking heel to toe with a slightly exaggerated hip sway.- Shorten your stride taking smaller steps alleviates the pressure when you hit the ground. And it helps you to avoid falling flat on your face.See? Not hard at all. Now all you need to do is enter the Sisters with Blisters Walk by visiting www.sisterswithblisters.co.za!

Remove from heat and allow for cooling – slight cooling, don’t let it go cold.Place the sugar, eggs and flour in a bowl with the melted chocolate mixture and combine them with a hand whisk.Stir through the remaining chocolate pieces and pour batter into a lined/greased baking tin, about 20 x 30 cm.Bake for 30 minutes or until cooked.Let them cool in the tin and then cut into squares.Enjoy!"

        "content": "Packing for a trip (whether for two weeks or two days) can be daunting, especially when there’s a weight limit involved.Because so many of us have faced this challenge at one time or another we’ve gathered a few tips that might help you pack light without compromising the art of looking fabulous!If you have any tips that you would add to this list, don’t hesitate to share!A little research goes a looooong way! We cannot stress this enough – if you check out what’s available to do in the area that you’re visiting and what the weather will be like, it will become clear whether takkies, boots, or stilettos are more appropriate.Love the Layers! Packing a few lightweight layers will save you heaps of space! That way you can start off a chilly morning warmly dressed and as the day heats up, remove the layers. We call it: refreshing your look.The List. Lists are an extremely practical way to prevent over-packing as you won’t be tempted to throw in items that you definitely won’t use. Lists are also handy for insurance purposes. Did you know that the more valuable items can be specified on your portable possessions policy? This way if anything disastrous happens, claiming will be hassle-free. What we love about 1st for Women’s Portable Possessions Insurance is that it gives you world-wide cover and more peace of mind than relying on airport insurance.Mini is IN! Bigger is not always better – especially when it comes to packing your toiletries. Don’t you just love buying the mini versions of your shampoo and conditioner? Dischem has a travel section with mini bottles of hair care products, shaving foam, etc. and Dermalogica has a wonderful travel range! It’s more than just an excuse to go shopping - it’s a practical way to save space and weight.Buy when you’re there. As if we needed a better reason to do some holiday shopping? Instead of hastily shoving a lot of ‘what-ifs’ into your bag, do the best that you can and realise that if it’s a hassle to have left it behind, it can be bought when you arrive.Colour Schemes. This doesn’t have to be limiting, in fact it can be quite freeing to pack according to a colour scheme. You can mix and match and produce numerous outfits from only a few pieces, which is particularly helpful when packing according to weight restrictions.Let’s get ROLLING! Bigger, bulky pieces can be rolled to save space, although I certainly don’t suggest this for your smaller, more lightweight items - these will only end up getting creased. Think of it like rolling your socks – it saves space in your cupboard, so why wouldn’t it work for your luggage?A little Soap! These take up so little space that they’re totally worth it, so pack a few washing detergent sachets. Being able to hand wash a few items gives you the flexibility to re-wear items. Whilst we’re on this subject, remember that darks don’t show dirt that easily, and that woollen items dry a lot quicker than other materials.And finally… Give yourself plenty of time to pack. Rushing leads to nothing more than over-packing and forgetting items that would have made more sense than a shirt that can’t be worn with anything other than one other pair of shoes."

        "content": "Being single is a fabulous thing, even if every romcom that you see might suggest otherwise.The trouble is that there comes along a moment during which you forget how much fun being single is… that’s when you need to remind yourself of a few reasons why having you all to yourself is awesome!Here is a top 10 list that we found, which you’re more than welcome to add to.1. High standards When you’re single you start to realise how much you value your freedom and me-time, which makes it pretty hard for you to ‘settle’ for anything less than sheer perfection, right? That’s round about the time when you realise that it’s ok to have high standards and that you don’t have to date just any “Joe Shmo”.2. Shaving is a choice! This may not seem like a big deal, but when you think about it, shaving your legs can be a real sign of love. Especially when winter hits. Now you only have to shave when YOU want to. Hazzah!3. Knowing yourself Oscar Wilde once said, \"To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance.” How true! And if we’re honest here, you can’t really love yourself if you don’t know who you are – so take advantage of the time you have to really get to know who you are.4. Social goddess alert! There is so much free time to devote to making plans with different friends. There’s happy hour, coffee dates, dinner parties, pamper days, movies, checking out new bars, concerts... Your social calendar can be as full as you want – and the best part is that when you need to check out for some much-needed me-time, you’re at liberty to do so.5. Freedom Want to change careers? Move to Mexico? Take up bird watching? Go to China and become a Kung Fu expert? What about giving up that high-powered job and working in a bookshop in a rustic part of England? This is your time to do this. So go out there and pursue different passions and interests, connect with who you are, be as adventurous as you wish and see where your heart takes you.6. It’s ok to be selfish Singlehood allows you the type of freedom that isn’t the same when you are in a relationship. For instance you can choose exactly how many George Clooney movies you want to watch in one sitting, you don’t have to share that slab of chocolate stashed away for a peaceful moment, or compromise on how you want to spend your weekends… Enjoy!7. The tinglies The tinglies (as we’ve dubbed them) is a delicious feeling of anticipation. This feeling needs to be relished when you’re single. The amazing part is that you could experience the tinglies at any time, maybe when you turn the corner and bump into a stranger, or pop into your local café and almost spill your coffee on the guy at the counter…8. Your money is yours The fantastic thing is that your money is just that: yours. If you decide to choose shoes over groceries, well that’s just fine. You can decide which savings plans you want to use, which insurance is better for you, and which investments you want to explore.9. “We need to talk”  These are hands down the four worst words to hear when you’re in a relationship, but when you’re single… well let’s just say that there’s nobody pointing out your flaws when you just don’t want to hear it.10. Indulge  In my opinion, the definition of ‘indulge’ is to yield to an inclination or desire and being single certainly makes this a well-travelled road. It’s not just food, but also hobbies and favourite pastimes. Singlehood allows for a second slice of cake, an extra-long bubble bath, or what about turning left instead of right – just to find out what’s down the road..?"

        "content": "Winter is all about the boots, scarves, hot chocolate, crackling fires and chunky soups. That being said, we’re sympathetic to those who prefer the summer heat. In fact, that’s what motivated this post!If you already have a deep love for wintery weather then you need no further persuasion, but for the summer kids out there, here’s a list of fabulous things that make winter cool (serendipitous pun)!1. Woollen Treats This one’s a double-whammy, as it not only involves the opportunity to wear wrap-around-three-times scarves, but you can also knit them yourself! The idea of wearing, much less creating chunky knitwear when it’s warm is preposterous, so that makes it a must-have AND must-do this winter.2. Specialty Hot Chocolate Belgian, French, Swiss, Italian, German… Put a new twist on hot chocolate this season! Add a slab or so of your favourite chocolate to a pot of hot milk (you can judge quantities – it’s all about the journey) and then stir until melted. If you want to shortcut this, try using your microwave – just remember to stir every now and then. Oh, and add a dollop of cream for a really rich experience!3. Vintage Capes Incorporate a dash of mystery to your winter look with a well-tailored vintage cape! Whether it’s fringed, woollen or velvet, the addition of fairy-tale elements making their way into your everyday wardrobe is a welcome treat. Are you summery folk coming round to the cold side yet?4. The Grand Novels Many an avid reader struggles in the heat, but during the winter months you can snuggle up on the couch, sip on some hot chocolate or creamy chai tea and drift off into another world. And speaking of drifting off – catching up on all the best reads allows you the perfect opportunity to snooze in between chapters, which is exactly what chilly Sunday afternoons are made for!5. Oh, the Shopping! A variety of richly coloured tights, grandpa cardigans, and knee-high boots – these are practically staples in many a wardrobe. With all the opportunities to layer, you can create quite the mood board of colours and textures. This is precisely the stuff that winter wardrobes allow for, and fashion, as per usual, doesn’t fail to deliver a multitude of to-die-for garments.6. Comfort Food Banish the salads, light fish dishes and sorbets, and bring on the meaty stews, creamy soups and steaming puddings! Don’t get us wrong, salads are delicious, but when the cold settles in there’s nothing better than butter running down a warm hunk of ciabatta bread – especially if it’s about to be dipped in mom’s famous butternut soup.7. Red lipstick Red lipstick… Ah what a journey that is. Finding the perfect shade for your skin tone and taste is not a once-off adventure, because with every season comes a need for a companionable red lipstick. That’s our reasoning for having seven different shades that occupy a little make up baggie all on their own. Winter is the perfect time to introduce a bold red to your repertoire, and trumps the lighter colours that are reserved for the warmer months.8. Cuddly Pyjamas Remember sweltering sleepless nights, lying there with the windows open and the fan (or AC) on full speed? Well now that winter’s here, you can look forward to cuddly pyjamas and poufy bedding that makes you feel little and dainty when encompassed by all the pillows and duvets. Waking up each morning and revelling in the warmth of your bed makes winter a true winner.9. Jogging Now we know that for many this will come as a shock – why would you ruin hot chocolate and comfort food weather with the thought of exercise? While we’re not experts in personal training, exercising in winter does have a few positives. Firstly, you can work out a little harder in order to warm up quicker. Secondly, you don’t pick up as much “winter wobble”. This means that come summer, there will be no need to go on any tasteless crash diets (which don’t work and are bad for you if you ask us).10. Crackling fires A toasty fire is just the ticket for movie nights and dinner soirees with close friends. A fireplace emits a pleasant glow that warms an entire room, which makes it a good reason to look forward to winter. This is definitely one Wintery Lovely that just cannot be appreciated in summer and perfectly ends off our Top Wintery Lovelies post!"

        "content": "If you’re a working mom then doing it all has a much deeper meaning. Laundry, cooking, packing school lunches, traffic, taxis, deadlines, meetings… the question is, how do you do it all?These helpful tips might do the trick if you’re at your wits end.Delegation is vital Most of us have clear memories of star charts, assigned chores and rewards, so whip up a list for your family. That way beds get made, tables are set, dishes are washed, and laundry is brought to the washing machine – and it wasn’t all by the sweat of your brow.Do it the night before Mornings always run smoother if you prepare for them the night before, so put your gym bag at the front door, lay out your outfit, and get the kids to prepare their lunches and backpacks for the next day. In fact a “Night Before” checklist on the fridge works a treat for a few moms out there – especially if it hangs next to the after-school activities calendar.You-Time This definitely goes on the list because moms tend to put themselves last. It’s difficult to keep giving of yourself if you’re not topping up your own inner tank. That’s why you need to take care of yourself: go to the gym, get a manicure, meet a friend for coffee, read a magazine and enjoy a great slice of cake that you don’t have to share with little mouths, or work on your hobby. Whilst some moms prefer to do this once a month, if you can manage it, try do something for yourself once a week.Work Schedules Your work is important, but it has its place: at the office. Chat to your boss or co-workers and figure out a way to leave on time so that you don’t let work pressures eat into your family time. If working late is unavoidable – cut yourself some slack (internal guilt trips are the enemy), arrange with your spouse/partner or family to help with the kids at home, and remember that you are doing the best that you can!Plan your Meals This way you don’t end up running to the shops more than once a week – and if you’ve already faced a bit of traffic on the way home this can be a real stress-reliever. One single working mom informed us that she’s taken to devoting a Saturday or two out of the month to cook a few single-dish meals for the freezer, like lasagne. If your kids are old enough, you can involve them in jotting down a few meal suggestions and let them help you cook.Quality Family Time This can range from planning a family movie night once a week and letting everyone have a turn to make their pick, to eating dinner together, or even attending a child\"s sporting event as a family. Bonding together creates lasting memories that are definitely worth making.Remember, ‘mommy-knowledge’ shared by one is a piece of sanity gained by many, so let us in on any tips that help you manage the circus that is your work-family-life balance!"

        "content": "Having your handbag stolen very often translates into weeks of costly and time-consuming admin which one can ill afford, especially over the festive season.  It is barely an exaggeration to say that a woman carries her life in her handbag, and insuring the contents of a handbag is extremely prudent.The prevalence of theft across South Africa makes handbag insurance a must-have item for peace of mind. 1st for Women offers handbag insurance to the value of R3500.00 with every home contents insurance policy.Robyn Farrell, managing director of 1st for Women Insurance says: “This holiday season, two of the most important things a woman can do to improve her safety is to stay aware of her surroundings and to avoid potentially dangerous situations. “If your attention is elsewhere because you are reading a magazine on the beach or sun tanning, you will be less aware of potential danger,” says Farrell.1st for Women offers tips on how to avoid having your handbag stolen:Be aware of your surroundings and carry your handbag close to your body, tucked in the bend of your elbow.Carry your handbag on the side furthest from the road. Never let the bag or strap hang loosely.Make sure your handbag is fastened and zipped at all times. Minimise the amount of cash that you carry in your handbag.  Rather divide your cash between your pockets and purse.Never leave your handbag on your passenger seat when driving.  Rather place it by your feet or in the vehicles boot. When seated at a cinema or a restaurant, always make sure your handbag is either on your lap or between your feet. Never leave your bag unattended.Make sure not to leave your keys buried in your handbag so that you stand around scrabbling for them.  This only attracts attention.If you are a victim of a handbag snatching, do not fight to hold onto your bag. Report the incident, and where it took place, to the nearest police station.  Also make sure to cancel all your credit cards and put a block on your cellphone.“Lastly, it is extremely upsetting having possessions forcibly taken from you, but it becomes far worse when you can’t quite remember what exactly was stolen. It is vital that you ensure that you have all this information documented in a safe place,” concludes Farrell."

The bliss was evident!The feedback we have received has been fantastic. For example, a Durban-based customer said:“My mum and I would like to convey our heartfelt gratitude for the pamper day at Mangwanani Spa that 1st for Women Insurance so kindly sponsored. It was truly heavenly! Both Mangwanani and 1st for Women provided us with a warm welcome and made us feel so special.   Apart from the indulgent spa treatments, excellent food and beverage service and celestial setting, the organisation of the event was on target and the general sentiment of the ladies on the day was so positive. I didn’t know how stressed I was, until I was distressed! I have only had positive experiences when dealing with 1st for Women.   This is a breath of fresh air in an industry that does not enjoy a good reputation. From the informative and helpful advice provided by your call centre consultants, affordable cover and friendly and efficient service, to the many customised benefits you offer your customers -make us feel like more than just a “policy number”. To date I have referred two other family members to 1st for Women Insurance and will continue to be a brand ambassador and spread the word about the excellent customer service experienced.”"

        "description": "",
        "content": " - Am I entitled to a pro rata refund if I cancel my policy in the middle of the month? (Premium Queries) - Our policies are payable monthly and you pay for cover a month in advance. We are therefore not able to refund you if you cancel the policy during the course of a month. - Can I insure two separate addresses on one policy? - No. You would have to insure the addresses on separate policies. This is because different addresses present different risks and you would pay different premiums for each of the addresses. - Can I pay my premium annually? (Premium Queries) - Unfortunately, we do not accept any annual payments - Can I take a loan against my Cash Back Bonus? - Unfortunately the submission of a claim is unpredictable so the Cash Back Bonus has no loan value. - Can my age affect my premium? (Premium Queries) - Experience has shown that driving risk reduces with age; older drivers have fewer accidents than young or new drivers. So we charge premiums according to a sliding scale, where an 18-year-old driver will pay the highest premium and the premium loading reduces over the years. If you want to know more about how the premiums scale works call us on 0861 00 30 01. - Do you insure Kruger Rands? - We do not cover coins, so if the Kruger Rand is simply in its coin form it will not be covered. However, if it had been set into a piece of jewellery (pendant, bracelet etc.), it may be insured as a jewellery item. - How do I obtain documentation for my policy? - You can either call us directly on 0861 00 30 01 to request any documentation for your policy or you can simply go online. - I am having difficulty logging into the website because I forgot my password? - You no longer need your password, enter your ID or Passport number on the login page and we will send you an OTP in order to login. - If I cannot afford my premium this month, can I pay double next month? (Premium Queries) - Sometimes, not often though you may find it difficult to meet the premium payments on the first working day of the month. In order to assist you if you do find yourself in this position, 1st for Women can set aside a Special Deduction on a date which is more convenient. However, if the premium is not received by this date, you will have no cover for that period for which the premium was due and the policy will lapse. This means that, although the contract is still in force, there is no cover for that period. If we do not receive payment for that month, you unfortunately do not have cover. - Is it true that my marital status can affect my premium? (Premium Queries) - Yes. We have found that married or co-habiting policy holders pose a lower risk than single or divorced people do. This is possibly because single people often go out, are on the road more, and leave their residences empty more often. - The system is not recognising my cell number, email address or my ID number, so I can\"t log in? - If you have a new email address or cell phone number, simply call us on 0861 00 30 01 and we will update it on our system. Then you should be able to continue as per usual. - What do I need to do to cancel my policy? - A 1st for Women policy allows you to cancel without any period of notice, but you can give notice to cancel on a future date. You can also give this notice of cancellation over the telephone. We will confirm the cancellation in writing. - What factors are taken into account in determining what premium I pay? (Premium Queries) - At 1st for Women, numerous things are taken into account, for example, the make and model of your motor vehicle, where you live, where your vehicle is kept at night, who the driver of the vehicle is, what purpose your vehicle is used for, and your previous claims history. Because your premium is calculated on these facts, amongst others, it is very important that you are honest when answering these and any other questions. If you are not sure about an answer, rather tell the consultant this and get back to them later. It is important to be honest in your dealings with your insurer or broker, including when you claim. Fraud costs the insurance industry millions every year and in turn costs you, the honest consumer, in increased premiums. Remember fraud ranges from things like claiming for a leather jacket you never had in the first place after a burglary, to claiming for a car that was allegedly hijacked when in fact it was actually sold. Fraud can also lead to a criminal record as most insurers prosecute customers who have committed fraud. - What is a Cashback and when does it pay out? - This optional extra rewards you by giving you money back if you remain claim-free for four consecutive years. We&rsquo;ll pay you out your entire first year&rsquo;s premiums, or up to 25% of all your premiums paid over those four years &ndash; whichever is the lesser. - What is the difference between the retail, trade and market value of my car? - Trade value: The value a dealer would give you for your car if you trade it in (depending on condition). The trade value option is not available if the vehicle is financed.Retail value: The value that a consumer would pay a dealership for the car after the dealer had added their mark-up and is, therefore, the closest value to a vehicles replacement value.Market value: This value is an average of the Trade value and the Retail value.Private use: You use your vehicle for social, domestic or pleasure purposes including travel to &amp; from work, excluding using the vehicle for business &amp; professional purposes.Business use: You use your vehicle for business, such as a sales rep.Occasional Business: You use your vehicle for social, domestic or pleasure purposes, driving to &amp; from work &amp; for some professional or business calls, which are 10 or less times per month.Car Pooling: Where you share driving &amp; vehicles with other people more than 60% of the time.Commuting: Where you drive to &amp; from work or the train station more than 12 days out of a month. - When my vehicle is damaged in an accident, can I have it repaired at the panel beater of my choice? - Our policy stipulates that we will repair your vehicle using a supplier on our panel. Our motor body repairers guarantee their workmanship and issue a lifetime guarantee on the repairs. This allows us to constantly monitor the quality of the repairs carried out by the repairers that we work with. However, should you insist that you want your vehicle repaired by a panel beater of your choice; we will give you a cash settlement in lieu of the amount that it would have cost us to repair your vehicle. In such an event, we can obviously not guarantee the repairs of the vehicle. - Where do I send my inspection certificate? - The app will automatically upload your details. Should you have a manual inspection done, you can email your inspection certificate to onlinesupport@firstforwomen.co.za. - Where do I take my vehicle for inspection? - To have your vehicle inspected you can download our app to do your very own self inspection. - Who can make changes to my policy? - Only you, the policyholder, are allowed to make amendments to your policy. - Why am I charged a penalty fee if my initial deduction was not successful? (Premium Queries) - The penalty fee is charged as 1st for Women had to re-submit your premium payment and incurred additional bank charges. - Why are my children disallowed drivers on the vehicle on the policy? - There are many factors that could affect whether or not your children are disallowed drivers on your policy. These factors consist of age, vehicle type and the risk profile of your children. - Why do I need to install a tracking device in my vehicle? - We strongly recommend that you install a tracking device in your vehicle because it increases the chances of recovering your vehicle if it is stolen. Because these chances are increased, your risk decreases, and this means that when you claim for a stolen vehicle your theft excess will be much lower. - Why does my premium increase every year even though the value of my car depreciates? (Premium Queries) - You are not only covered for the theft of your vehicle but also for the repair of your vehicle. The cost of repairing your vehicle and parts used increase every year, so your premium unfortunately has to increase in line with these costs. 1st for Women does, however, take the depreciating value of your vehicle into account when reviewing your premium. - Why is a vehicle inspection necessary? - We inspect most cars before providing insurance cover to make sure that the car exists and to record all current damage. If the vehicle has any accessories fitted, these will be noted on the inspection certificate, which in turn speeds up the claim finalisation process. This inspection is conducted free of charge to you. We do not inspect cars which are insured for Third Party only, except when a vehicle is insured for third party only and the client has selected sound equipment cover to the value of R5 000 or more. - Will I be able to register once and have access to all the policies I hold with 1st for Women using one email address? - Yes, you will be able to see all your policies on one profile. - Will I be able to view my policy details online without having registered? - Provided you have a policy with us, you can use you ID or Passport number on the login page. - When do I have my policy annual review? (Premium Queries) - Your policy review will be done every year on the anniversary of when your policy started. - If I have questions about my policy annual review, who can I speak to? (Premium Queries) - You can discuss your review with our customer care department. - What is an excess? (Excess) - An excess is the amount you have to pay in the event of a loss and is the uninsured portion of your loss. The excess serves to prevent customers from submitting minor claims as well as fraudulent claims and assists in keeping premiums down. Let\"s use motor excess as an example. When you submit a claim you will have to pay an excess, irrelevant of who was to blame for the accident. It is important to read your policy documentation regarding excesses as there may sometimes be additional excesses depending on the facts of your claim, e.g. who was driving your vehicle at the time of the loss. In most cases we offer a flat excess as opposed to an excess that is a percentage of your loss. We will also do our best to try and recover your excess from a guilty third party even though there is no legal obligation for us to do so. This is a service 1st for Women offers to customers at no extra charge. - How can I reduce my excess? (Excess) - You can definitely reduce your excess. The way to do this is by increasing your premium. You can also reduce your premium by increasing your excess. - Why do I have to pay an excess if I was not at fault? (Excess) - An excess is payable whenever a claim is submitted and is the first payment that needs to be made in the event of a claim &ndash; regardless of whether you are guilty or not. The administrative cost of a claim is the same, regardless of who is at fault. If you are not at fault, you can claim the amount back from the other party. Unfortunately, this can take a long time, especially if the guilty party isn\"t insured. Our legal recoveries department will do their utmost to recover your excess, at no extra charge. - Why is an additional excess payable if someone else drives my vehicle? (Excess) - Premiums are based on the details of the most regular driver only. We provide cover for someone else to drive the vehicle occasionally without increasing the premium, but with an additional excess payable in case of a claim. - How do I submit a claim? (Claim) - You can submit a claim by phoning our Claims Department or or you can submit you claim via the 1st for Women App  - What happens to my Cash Back Bonus if I claim? (Claim) - It is important to note that there are claims that will affect your Cash Back Bonus, which will be forfeited and reset to accumulaWill I be able to view myte over the next four consecutive years. - If someone drives my vehicle without my consent and is involved in an accident, will you still pay my claim? (Claim) - Yes, provided that you lay a criminal charge against that person with the police, within 48 hours. You may not withdraw the charge. - Can someone else submit a claim on my behalf? (Claim) - Only the policyholder can submit claims against a policy. This ensures security and confidentiality of all personal information. - How long do I have to submit a claim? (Claim) - You have 30 days from the date that you become aware of the incident to submit a claim."

        "description": "",
        "content": " - What is an electrical grid failure? - Firstly, it&rsquo;s important to note that electrical grid failure is different to load shedding. Simply, load shedding is a controlled interruption of electricity supply to prevent the collapse of the national power grid. Electrical grid failure is the total or partial loss of power &ndash; which could result in a total blackout for weeks and affect municipalities and public infrastructure. - Will I still be covered during electrical grid failure? - Electrical grid failure is not an insured peril. If you are claiming for damages that were not a direct result of electrical grid failure, as defined in your insurance policy, you will still have cover. - Will I still have cover for power surges after the electrical grid has been restored? - Yes, you will have cover for damage to the insured property due to a power surge. - Can I claim for deterioration of food during electrical grid failure? - No, deterioration of food due to electrical grid failure is not covered. - Will my car insurance cover me when the traffic light is out due to electrical grid failure, and I have an accident? - Yes, you will still enjoy cover. - Will I still have theft cover during an electrical grid failure if the alarm at the risk address was not functional due to lack of battery support? - Yes, you will still have theft cover during electrical grid failure subject to the terms of your insurance policy. However, please note that it is a requirement of your policy to take all reasonable steps and precautions to prevent or limit any potential losses. You are therefore still required to take the necessary precautions to limit a loss. - What is meant by the exclusion of “consequential loss” caused by electrical grid failure? - This means that if a loss occurs as a consequence of electrical grid failure, like the deterioration of food in a fridge, water disruption resulting in geyser damage for example, a sewage system failure or a gas supply failure, it will not be covered as electrical grid failure is not an insured peril. - Can I buy cover for electrical grid failure? - It is not possible to provide cover for a complete failure of the electrical grid and the associated losses."

The benefit is available to the regular driver.How does Mobile Crash Detection work?Through the 1st for Women application, the mobile crash detector can detect movement and speed by using the smartphone&rsquo;s GPS and accelerometer. From here the embedded algorithm understands when the regular driver is in motion. Should she/he be in an accident, it can calculate the likelihood of impact and will automatically trigger an alert if the algorithm measures a force equal to a severe accident.A medically trained emergency assist consultant will then phone the regular driver to confirm if she/he needs emergency medical assistance. If she/he confirms the need for assistance or does not answer her/his phone, the consultant will immediately dispatch the nearest emergency medical service (EMS) to the exact accident location recorded by the app at the time of the accident.When does the Mobile Crash Detection benefit on the app work?The app uses smart drive-detection technology to automatically switch on when you start driving and begin monitoring your trip. It will automatically detect a severe vehicle accident and instantly alert the 1st for Women emergency assist provider, who will phone the relevant user to confirm if she/he needs emergency medical assistance.If the regular driver confirms the need for assistance or does not answer her/his phone, the nearest emergency medical services (EMS) will be dispatched to the accident location recorded by the app. Please note that the app must be running with the driver signed in, and with the location services switched on for the Mobile Crash Detection benefit to work.Who will respond to my emergency?The emergency contact centre consultant is able to immediately dispatch the nearest emergency medical services (EMS) and supply them with the registered user&rsquo;s medical information, if received from the regular driver.If I need medical assistance, where will I be taken?The 1st for Women Mobile Crash Detection benefit is only an early alert system for emergency medical services (EMS) to be dispatched to your location. The standard EMS&rsquo; processes and procedures will determine the medical treatment provided and the medical facilities used.What will your response times be?This app was designed to minimise the time-consuming factors that could possibly delay the emergency medical services&rsquo; (EMS) response times. While impossible to give an exact response time, it would be accurate to say that there is an immediate responding call once an alert is triggered.Why do you need my medical information, and is my information safe with you?By completing your medical information on the app, we can assist the EMS in responding to your accident with relevant information to give you the best possible medical care.Your information will be stored on the app&rsquo;s server and will only be accessed and shared with the selected EMS when the system has alerted them to a severe accident.If my nominated drivers&rsquo; medical information changes, how do I update it?By installing and logging into the 1st for Women app, you will have instant access to update and save your medical aid details and medical conditions as frequently as needed. Each user must update their medical information through the Mobile Crash Detection section on the app.What constitutes a severe accident?We use an algorithm that monitors a variety of sensors on your phone. This algorithm activates only when the vehicle is in motion. Through understanding this, we can eliminate \"false positives\" such as accidentally dropping the phone and only monitor the sensors of a mobile phone when driving. If I don&rsquo;t want this product, can it be excluded?The product is offered as part of our assist offering and is included as a benefit to your 1st for Women policy. If the regular driver decides to not download, register or use the app, then they will not benefit from this assist offering.Is Mobile Crash Detection different from my Accident Assist / Medical Assist?Yes, this is an early alert system that is designed to automatically detect a severe vehicle accident. Its main goal is to minimize the EMS response times by accurately identifying the location of the accident. Additionally, it also ensures appropriate medical attention by providing vital patient information directly to the first responder.Will I be able to capture my next of kin details to contact in case of an emergency?No, we will send your information and location directly to the relevant EMS who will determine the severity of the accident. It is part of the EMS service to then get hold of your next of kin, if needed.Will the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) be dispatched in the event of an accident in which I am driving someone else&rsquo;s vehicle or if I am a passenger in another vehicle?Yes. If you are the regular driver, signed into the app with your smartphone and all relevant settings switched on, emergency medical services (EMS) will be dispatched.

        "content": " - Globally, lockdowns have caused an increase in domestic violence and abuse and South Africa is not immune. The National GBV Command Centre is receiving triple the amount of calls from women who are trapped with their abusive partners at home during the national lockdown. As long-term advocates in the fight against women abuse, we supported the National GBV Command Centre in its efforts to help those who need it. One of the ways we&rsquo;ve assisted the Command Centre is through the provision of debriefing services for social workers and supervisors. We have received heart-warming feedback from the staff about the benefit of these services, which are designed to help reduce secondary traumatic stress and burnout. Are you at risk of abuse or do you know someone who is? Report it: GBV Command Centre: 0800 428 428 or *120*786# - We also launched a crowdfunding campaign to support nurses on the frontline of COVID-19, partnering with Gift of the Givers and Vula Mobile. The fundraising effort was kick-started with a R500 000 donation from 1st for Women. For more information, please visit: https://www.backabuddy.co.za/for-the-nurses"

        "content": " - If your insured vehicle is damaged due to a hijacking, this extra loss or damage that happens as a direct result of an insured peril is called resultant damage. - The monthly deduction that goes off your account every month, for your insurance, is your premium. - The Financial Sector Conduct Authority imposes these rules on insurers to ensure that we treat our policyholders fairly. - The person who takes out a policy is the policyholder and is not always the same person as the insured. For example, you could take out insurance for your child&rsquo;s car, making them the insured and you the policyholder. - This is a personalised document that lists details like your cover, premium, deduction dates, excesses, and endorsements, and all other relevant details. Every time you make a change to your policy, like a changed address or an added vehicle, your policy schedule will be updated. - This is the contract between you and us, regarding the cover you&rsquo;ve chosen, and the terms and conditions that apply. - If you&rsquo;re injured, disabled or pass away following an accident, you will be covered by Personal Accident Insurance. - If you disagree with a decision made by us, like we rejected your claim, you can approach the relevant Insurance Ombudsman - an independent official who investigates complaints made by the insured against an insurer. He/she is responsible for protecting the interests of both parties and for settling disagreements between the two fairly. - This is a nice one! If you haven&rsquo;t claimed for a certain number of years (usually between one and five), you could qualify for an NCB. This means you could get a discount on your premium. There are certain criteria for receiving this bonus, like having had comprehensive insurance, without interruption, for a set period. - When taking out an insurance policy, we ask a lot of questions. We do this to fully understand your risk and needs. If you&rsquo;re not honest when answering these questions, and don&rsquo;t share the information we need to know before accepting your risk, this is known as material misrepresentation. - This is anything that will influence our decision to insure you or not, and if so, what terms and conditions apply. This will include things like excesses and policy exclusions. - This is the act of deliberately causing damage to your property. - We may send a loss adjuster to your home to assess the damage or loss that you&rsquo;re claiming for. They will ask questions to clarify the facts of the claim, provide a summary of this validation and a recommendation to the insurer who will make the final decision. - Loss includes loss of or damage to property, and third-party injury or death. There are four categories of loss:Liability losses/third-party lossesOwn damage lossesSentimental lossesConsequential lossesLiability Losses/Third-party Losses &ndash; this is when you&rsquo;re held legally responsible for damage to someone else\"s property; and/or injury or death of a third party.  A court can hold you liable for either of these, and order you to compensate the third party accordingly. You&rsquo;d suffer a loss because you&rsquo;d have to pay money to clear yourself of this liability.Own Damage LossesLosses you may suffer if there is damage to your own property or if you&rsquo;re injured as result of an insured peril. Own damage losses can result from a number of insured perils, which are defined in your insurance policy.Sentimental LossesA loss that insurance cannot pay for because the value of the item is sentimental and not financial. A scrapbook or photo album is an example of this. - This is also referred to as third-party insurance and provides cover for a third party if you&rsquo;re held legally liable for their death or injury, or for damage to their property. There are two types of liability insurance:Personal liability: This relates to you as an individual, when you are held personally liable for the death or injury of a third party, or for damage to his/her property.Public liability: This relates to businesses and provides compensation for claims made against them. For example, if a customer falls and breaks his leg after tripping over an uneven step at an office building and claims against the business for the injury, this is a public liability claim. To put it plainly, a member of the public is holding the business responsible for the injury. - Our risk based on two factors:1. The probability of damage or loss occurring:  This is all about how likely it is that a loss will happen. For example, in South Africa, your car is more likely to be damaged in an accident than an earthquake. So, the probability of loss from an accident is high while the probability of loss from an earthquake is low.2. The cost resulting from that loss or damage:  This is about the money that will be lost and the terms high and low are used to describe this. For example, a car worth R500 000 is much more expensive to repair or replace than one worth R130 000. So, the first car is a high risk while the second is a low risk. - If you don&rsquo;t pay your insurance premium on time, your policy will lapse. For example, if your premium is due on 1 February, and your deduction does not go through, the insurer will allow a 15-day grace period before attempting a second deduction. (Note: This grace period only applies if the policy has been active for a minimum of two months). If that is successful you will have cover. If not, you won&rsquo;t be covered. You do however have the option to arrange a special deduction, which will then cover you on a pro-rata basis for the rest of the month. - Insured perils are events that are unexpected or accidental and include events like fire, theft or flooding. These are specific risks or causes of damage or loss that are covered by insurance. - This is us, the company who agrees to indemnify or compensate you for losses resulting from insured perils. - In essence, this is an arrangement between you, the insured, and us, the insurance company. We offer you indemnity or compensation for liability, damage, or loss from insured perils. - In order to insure something, you need to have an insurable interest in it, meaning that youbenefit financially from its protection, or you could suffer financially if it was lost or damaged. Generally, insurable interest is based on ownership or legal possession. - Any person (over the age of 15) who lives with you at your insured address (excluding tenants and domestic workers) are considered household members. - Any person (over the age of 15) who lives with you at your insured address (excluding tenants and domestic workers) are considered household members. - A good way to look at this is to imagine turning your house upside down &ndash; your home contents are all the items that would fall out. Items must be insured for their current replacement value, not what you may have paid for them when you bought them. Also remember that you can&rsquo;t choose which items you&rsquo;d like to insure like a fridge or TV.  Another term you may come across with home contents is New for Old. This is when an insured item is lost or destroyed and is replaced with a brand new, similar item. - This is a condition that could create or increase the chance of a loss from an insured peril.When we consider your risk and decide whether to insure you or not, or for how much, we consider these important factors:A physical hazard &ndash; an example of this is a home without burglar bars.A moral hazard &ndash; this is harder to recognise as it relates to the integrity of the insured. - Good faith is so important in maintaining a good relationship between you and your insurer and it applies to both of you. When entering into an insurance contract, both the insured and the insurer do so in good faith. From our side, this means not misleading you or confusing you with any policy terms and conditions. From your side, this means disclosing all necessary information and not misrepresenting any facts that could be relevant to us accepting your risk. - These can be general or specific and are things that not covered by your insurance policy.General exclusions: Examples of this are riots or acts of war. These are events that are not covered by an insurer, no matter what cover is selected or which risk items they have insured.Specific exclusions: These are events that we won&rsquo;t cover. They only apply to specific insured items or cover types. For example, a specific exclusion under a vehicle policy is if you, or anyone you allow to drive your insured vehicle, or anyone acting on your behalf, leaves the vehicle&rsquo;s keys and/or ignition keys of your vehicle in or on the vehicle. - When you claim, there is usually a portion of the claim that isn&rsquo;t covered by insurance. This is what we call the excess. An excess could be either a fixed amount or a percentage of the claim amount. (If you&rsquo;re unsure about the excesses that apply to your cover, get in touch with us and we&rsquo;ll be happy to help.)There are four different types of excesses:Basic Excess &ndash; theminimum, first amount that you need to pay towards your claim. Additional Excess &ndash;paid in addition to the basic excess and is based on specific risks. For example, if a driver is under the age of 25 or has only had his/her licence for a certain number of years, additional excesses may apply.Voluntary Excess &ndash; you canchoose to increase your excess to lower your premium.Cumulative Excess &ndash; the sum of additional excesses, if they are all for the same claim.  - This is when we make a payment as an expression of goodwill. In other words, we are not liable under your policy to pay for your loss but do so to maintain a good relationship with you. Ex gratia payments cannot be regarded as a binding standard which will be followed by the insurer in the future. - This is an additional condition or restriction on your insurance policy. For example, you may have an endorsement on your home contents policy stating that you&rsquo;ll only be covered for burglary and theft if a burglar alarm is activated when you&rsquo;re not at home. - To disclose something means that you make information known whereas non-disclosure refers to the opposite &ndash; keeping information secret. It&rsquo;s your duty to disclose all information that could be relevant to your insurer accepting your risk. For example, if you move homes, you need to tell your insurer, as a change in address could change your risk. This could affect their willingness to keep giving you cover or to pay a claim. If you&rsquo;ve ever been found guilty of dishonesty or fraud before, you need to inform your insurer. - Insurers mayrefuse to take on a certain risk, enter into an insurance contract or cancel an existing insurance contract. When this happens, the request for insurance or continuation of insurance is declined.  There are various factors that can influence this decision including your previous claims history.  - A declaration is statement that provides true and complete information and doesn&rsquo;t exclude or misrepresent any material facts. The declarations you make form the basis of your insurance contract. If these are not true or misleading, we may cancel your insurance policy or reject your claim. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important to be upfront and honest with your insurer. - Noting of interest is when a third party (lender) is designated as the first loss payee in respect of any payment made under the policy. A good example is a life policy. This can be noted to a bank which has given a home loan to the policyholder. The life insurance noting will pay the bank proceeds of the life policy, before paying the beneficiaries of the policy. - The literal definition of cover is to &lsquo;protect or provide shelter for something&rsquo;. This is similar to what insurance provides. While insurance cannot stop events from happening, it helps you to recover financially by replacing or repairing your lost or damaged items, provided it is a result of an insured peril. - This is a legal agreement between you and us. it determines the claims which the insurer is legally required to pay. In exchange for payment, called the premium, the insurer promises to pay for loss caused by perils covered under the policy wording. The policy schedule, terms and conditions and any telephonic conversations all form part of the insurance contract. - Any loss or damage not directly caused by an insured peril but arising as a result of such damage. Amongst other things, this includes compensation for inconvenience, interest, money you lose or any liability (or legal responsibility) you may incur because of a delay in finalising your claim, or a delay in the repair or replacement of the item for which you claimed. - You are covered for just about any eventuality with Comprehensive Vehicle Cover. It includes cover for theft, loss, accidental damage to your car, as well as cover for third-party and fire damage. - This pays for loss or damage that you have suffered or for which you are legally liable. - Commission it the payment made by insurers to brokers and representatives for selling insurance policies for them. Commission also covers ongoing intermediary service that the intermediary provides to the client, such as varying or renewing a policy. The amount is regulated and is usually displayed on your policy schedule as a percentage of your premium. - This refers to the date and time your insurance cover starts. E.g. if your insurance policy commences on 1 March 2020 at 12:00 and you have an accident after that, you will have cover &ndash; as long as you stick to all the terms and conditions of your insurance policy. - This refers to the outcome of a claim &ndash; whether it is rejected or settled and how it will be done like repairing the item, replacing it or giving you cash to buy another one. - An insurance claim is basically a request to us to either pay you out, replace or repair an insured item. Whether we pay out, repair or replace is at our discretion. - This is one of the most critical terms to remember when it comes to your insurance policy. It&rsquo;s extremely important that you update us on changes that may affect your risk &ndash; this could be anything from moving home to changing where you park your car overnight.If you&rsquo;re unsure whether a change will affect your risk, get in touch with us to find out. It&rsquo;s always better to be safe than sorry as non-disclosure of certain information could affect your insurance policy and any claims you may have. - A burglary occurs when someone gains illegal access to your property, through force or violence, with the intention of stealing from you and/or causing damage. - A buildings insurance policy provides cover for the actual structure of your home and other buildings (example: domestic quarters, garages etc.). If the structures and/or its fixtures (excluding geysers) are damaged or destroyed, this would be covered under a buildings insurance policy. Specific terms and conditions apply, so check your policy book to see exactly what you&rsquo;re covered for. - A broker is a person or business that acts as the middleman between you and your insurer. When using a broker, you allow them to make decisions about your insurance policy and manage it for you. They give you advice on which cover to choose out and assist you with claiming. It&rsquo;s important to remember that brokers charge for their services and earn commission from the insurers they represent. - Betterment occurs when we need to replace an item that has wear and tear on it with a brand-new item. As wear and tear is not an insured peril, you are put in a better position than you were before the claim. For example, a tyre that has substantial mileage on it has to be replaced with a brand new one. Thus, we will deduct the amount, which we had to pay to place you in the better position, from your claim amount. - This term is used together with the terms underinsurance and settlement &ndash; because if you&rsquo;re underinsured, the average rule will apply and a settlement amount is what you&rsquo;ll receive. Look at this example of how the average rule works and the terms you need to know:Imagine you have a house that&rsquo;s insured under your buildings policy for R1 million. This is known as the sum insured. Let&rsquo;s say that a huge flash flood hits, the entire house is damaged and the cost to entirely rebuild it is R1.5 million. This is known as the value at risk. Now let&rsquo;s look at a different scenario &ndash; the flood destroys part of the house and the cost of repairs is R500 000. This is known as the loss. To calculate the settlement amount, the average calculation would be applied. Here&rsquo;s how it works:Sum insured            /   value at risk      x loss            = settlement R1 million                /     R1.5 million    x R500 000    = R333 333Amount not covered                                                    = R166 000                                 Now think about this instance: you&rsquo;ve insured the valuables in your home for R100 000 &ndash; the sum insured. All your valuables are swept away in the flash flood. The cost to replace them is R200 000 &ndash; the value at risk. In another scenario, there may be partial damage to your home contents. For example, a tree falls onto a part of the house, causing R20 000 worth of damage to your contents. This is known as the loss. To calculate the settlement amount, the average calculation would be applied. It works like this:Home ContentsSum insured            /  value at risk      x loss            = settlement R100 000                /     R200 000          x R20 000    = R10 000 Amount not covered                                                    = R10 000                                 This R10 000 is probably not a cost you were prepared for.NB: Ensure that you update your sum insured regularly to avoid paying the amount not covered out of your own pocket. - When your car, home or buildings are damaged due an insured peril, we will send an assessor to check the extent of the damage. He/she will put together a report for us and recommend how the claim should be handled based on their assessment. - Arson is the deliberate act of starting a fire, with the intention to cause harm to people and/or their property. Arson is generally not covered by insurance, but you&rsquo;ll need to check the terms and conditions that apply to your insurance policy. If someone sets fire to their own property just to get money out of their insurer, this is considered insurance fraud and it won&rsquo;t be covered (not to mention the legal implications could be very severe for that individual). - Sometimes, in an accident, both parties are to blame. The degree of &lsquo;blame&rsquo; is then split between the parties, to a max of 100%. An example of this is when both parties are equally to blame, then there is 50% - 50% apportionment. The percentage of responsibility placed on each party can be different and the cost of the damages is split according to this percentage. The payment, and who receives it, is based on the calculated difference after the apportionment percentage has been applied to each party&rsquo;s damages. - Your jewellery, watch, smartphone and laptop are some examples of portable possessions &ndash; the things you pretty much don&rsquo;t leave home without. Portable possessions are covered under an all risks policy and are divided into two types: unspecified and specified.Unspecified: This section offers cover for lower-valued items. These things do not need to be individually specified but you do need to select a total amount for which you want to cover all of them. The maximum amount that you could claim for, per item, under this section, is determined by the insurer. Specified: This section offers cover for higher-valued items. These items need to be individually specified and you will pay a premium for each of them. The minimum amount for a specified item is determined by the insurer. Possessions like cell phones, prescription glasses or bicycles must also be specified if you want them covered, regardless of their value. - This is extra cover that you can add to your policy, at an additional premium. It includes things like car hire or increased liability. - This is an injury that happens by accident &ndash; it is unintentional, unforeseen and sudden. - An accident is an incident that is unintentional, unforeseen and sudden. It can result in anything from damage and loss to injury and death. - If you take out an insurance policy with us, you&rsquo;re the insured. - This is important when it comes to claiming for something like an item of jewellery stolen in a burglary. We may ask to see an invoice or a valuation certificate with your details on it. This shows that you did, in fact, own the item. This is done to avoid fraudulent claims. - This is displayed on a document like an invoice or a valuation certificate and shows the value or cost of the insured item. - Pro rata refers to a part of something. In the insurance world, it&rsquo;s usually used in reference to premiums. For example, if you took out an insurance policy on 20 June, you would only pay a portion of the monthly premium (a pro rata premium) because you only had cover for a bit of the month (10 days instead of the full 30). - This is an estimated premium for your cover and may change depending on the type and amount of information you give us. - This is the person who drives an insured car the most and is listed on your policy schedule. You can have more than one regular driver per car. Always make sure that the regular driver/s are listed on your policy schedule. - Even insurance companies need insurance. Think about the impact of claims following a wide-spread flash flood. Thousands of customers will be claiming simultaneously, for large amounts. In this case we may need the help of our reinsurance company to cover the unexpected high cost of these claims. - If you&rsquo;ve cancelled your insurance with us and decide you want to take out the same policy again, we will reinstate it. - Every year we review your policy, during the month when your policy commenced. This is usually when premiums are adjusted based on various factors like the country&rsquo;s economic situation, changes in your risk profile and your claims in the previous year. We always send you a letter and an updated policy schedule at renewal stage. - There are numerous factors that influence our decision to reject a claim. One such factor could be due to the insured not sticking to the terms and conditions of their insurance policy.  - In insurance, there are different uses for the word risk. There are risks that apply to situations that involve danger, e.g., a fire risk. You, as the insured, could be considered a good or bad risk, depending on things like your insurance history. For example, if you&rsquo;ve made lots of claims in the past or had lots of interruptions in cover, you could be considered a bad risk, whereas, if you have a good claims history and have had continuous cover for many years, you would be considered a good risk. - If someone breaks into your car or home and you claim, your insurer may want to see signs of forced entry or exit as a condition of paying your claim. A sign of forced entry or exit could be a broken window or lock. - All drivers of vehicles on South African roads are automatically covered by the RAF for liability claims for death and injury caused by a third party. Because of this, all vehicle insurance policies in South Africa have exclusions for any cover provided for by the RAF.Who can claim from the RAF? A person who was injured in an accident (excluding a driver who was the sole cause of an accident);A dependent of a deceased breadwinner who was injured in an accident;A close relative of a deceased person who was injured in an accident, who paid for a funeral;A person under the age of 18 (with assistance from a parent or legal guardian) who was injured in an accident. - The property that is saved from a fire, storm, theft, or accident in either a damaged or a partially damaged state is called salvage. An example of this would be the wreck of an accident-damaged car, a stolen and recovered item, or a portion of a hi-fi set left after a burglary. - This is the amount that you insure your property for and is also the maximum amount that the insurer will pay for a claim. - These are the rules that relate to your chosen insurance cover. Follow them. - A third party is someone involved in a claim who is neither the insured nor the insurer. For example, if you drive into someone, the person in the other car is the third party. - This is the most cost-effective cover and allows you to claim for the damage you caused to other parties\" property. You will not be covered for the theft of your car and for any damages to your car with this type of cover. - As the name suggests, this insurance provides cover if you&rsquo;re in an accident and a third party is injured or their property, in this case their car, is damaged as a result. It also covers your vehicle for fire damage or if it&rsquo;s stolen. It doesn&rsquo;t cover any accident damage caused to your vehicle. - When the value of cover you have chosen for your property does not cover the full value of a claim, you are underinsured. An example would be if you took out buildings cover of R1 million for your home but the cost to rebuild your home is R2 million. This means you&rsquo;d be underinsured byR1 million. The principle of average will be applied to calculate the amount the insurer will pay. - An underwriter is the company that decides to accept a specific risk at a specific premium. This company appoints people who look at the risks of insuring a person and their property, based on their answers to specific underwriting questions, and other factors like their insurance and claims history. These people will decide on behalf of the underwriter whether or not to accept the risk, how much cover to provide and what premium to charge. - The process of gathering information from a potential customer to decide whether or not to accept the risk of insuring them and what premium to charge, is called underwriting. - This is a document that states the value of certain high-value items like jewellery or antiques. It can be used to show proof of ownership when claiming from your insurer. - Any motor vehicle or light delivery vehicle (LDV) as well as motorbikes, caravans and trailers. - When you have vehicle insurance, you are covered for various insured perils such as accidental damage, theft and third-party cover. The insured perils you&rsquo;re covered for will depend on what vehicle insurance you have. You have three options; comprehensive, third-party, fire and theft, or third-party only. - The damage caused to an item as the result of regular use or use over a long period of time is called wear and tear. This damage is not covered by insurance. - If you are in an accident and your vehicle is damaged beyond repair or the repairs would cost more than the value of the vehicle, an insurer will write-off the vehicle."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Despite the continued scourge of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in South Africa, sex education remains an elusive and somewhat contentious subject in many schools, creating a desperate need for intervention. According to Mara Glennie, CEO of leading anti-rape and sexual violence organisation, the TEARS Foundation, “There is currently a shocking lack of sex education available to South Africa’s youth.  While the material is provided to teachers in their life orientation syllabus, it is among a variety of topics they can choose from. With the many taboos still surrounding sex, most teachers shy away from the topic. It’s not addressed by the parents and guardians either, leaving youth without the critical knowledge they need on topics like consent and sexual health.” To bridge this gap, the TEARS Foundation has teamed up with 1st for Women Insurance and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) and, in conjunction with the Department of Basic Education (DBE), has launched a safe, easily-accessible and informative tech-enabled solution called SPEAK UP®. SPEAK UP® was created to enable and provide South African youth with sex education on their cellphones and assist users in making informed decisions about their sexual health. “Last year, it was found that 10% of rape cases reported nationally stem from higher education institutions. If the youth are properly educated, from an early age, with tools like SPEAK UP®, we would hope to see a decrease in these numbers by providing them with the relevant information,” says Glennie. Another national issue that SPEAK UP® aims to address is that of teen pregnancies. “Watching a young, underage child turn into a mother is heart-breaking. Children need to be children, not birthing them. It’s particularly devastating to learn that many of the girls who gave birth last year were barely teenagers,” says Glennie. SPEAK UP® is an extension of the award-winning TEARS Foundation tool – a free, national 24/7 USSD helpline (*134*7355#) which provides victims and survivors of rape and/or sexual abuse with emergency assistance, through a free call back option and contact information for their closest crisis centers. Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women says: “SPEAK UP® is a true breakthrough for sex education in South Africa.  Through a series of short, interactive and animated videos, with subtitles, in case the user needs to watch the video in private, we hope to break the taboos with accurate and relevant information so that the youth are able to make conscious, healthy and responsible choices about relationships and sexuality. The first set of videos covers topics including: consent, rape, pregnancy, depression, grooming, HIV/STIs and contraception.” The videos will be translated into Zulu, Xhosa and Afrikaans at a later stage. In addition, the videos can be shared with as many people as a user likes, enabling the content to reach even further. In line with TEARS philosophy that all its services are offered to victims and survivors of GBV for free, they have loaded their electronic and digital platforms on zero-rated sites, making it free to all users. TEARS will also carry the cost of reverse user charges and will source funding via donor outreach, like that of 1st for Women, IDC, and public donations.  “It is our hope that SPEAK UP® will challenge the youth to think critically about gender and about their role within their culture, community and society at large. While the information is mostly aimed at young people and youth-led and youth-serving organisations, we hope that it will also be useful to other organisations, volunteers and activists who want to begin or strengthen advocacy around improving sexual education across the world,” says Glennie.

        "description": "",
        "content": "In the US, the best time to buy a new car is in May as it’s the end of the winter and spring auto show seasons. As a result, new vehicles that were on display before have reached dealership floors. Dealers want to sell this “old” inventory and do so at a largely discounted price. For South Africans, October to December aresaid to be the best months to buy as many dealers run sales during this period. If you have your sights set on a car right now, the good news is that you’re spoilt for choice.   According to Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women Insurance,car buyers in South Africa are now facing a staggering array of automotive choices.  “Market research firm IBISWorld reveals that there are 793 global car and automobile manufacturing businesses as of 2023. – and, of course, many of those companies do business in South Africa. For the first time, those companies aren’t just producing cars with internal combustion engines. Instead, they’re offering electric cars, hybrids, and fuel-cell vehicles too. While this is good in that motorists have lots of cars from which to choose, it can also be tricky to make the right selection,” she points out.  The members of the Women’s World Car of the Year (WWCOTY) jury concur, stressing that – when buying a car – women need to take multiple factors into account. “The choice of a car depends on your situation,” says Sandy Myhre, New Zealand’s representative on the WWCOTY jury. “With children, practicality rules – so the buyer should investigate the ability to fit a couple of car seatsin the vehicle and also the possibility tostow many other odds and ends.”  Carla Ribeiro, Portugal’s representative, agrees that practicality is paramount: “Women need to look for a car that\"s easy to park, with a boot they can open with their hands full, anda second row of seats where it’s easy (and safe) to assemble and disassemble a car seat.”  Practicality is often the terrain of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and crossovers, whichare very popular with female motorists in South Africa. “SUVs are popular with women thanks to their all-round ability, high ground clearance, and four-wheel drive. Crossovers, meanwhile,can be a bit cheaper and lighter on fuel – although their off-road capabilities are not as pronounced,” notes Van Wyngaard.  The higher, larger body of SUVs can provide increased protection in the event of an accident, but there’salso another benefit to that high-up seating position. “Sitting higher off the ground also makes it easier to spot those craters we affectionately term potholes,” points out Charleen Clarke, WWCOTY judge for South Africa.  Electric cars are still struggling to gain a foothold in South Africa, due to ongoing power supplyissues and a scarcity of affordable “wall charge” options. The lack of charging infrastructure also limits their current driving range. So, for now, a hybrid or a car with an internal combustion engine may be a more sensible buy.  In Europe, however, electric vehicles are alreadyvery much a reality. “I believe that women need to look for a reliable and precise navigation system, which shows all available electric charging stations. This is very important to me and makes life much easier,” says German juror Solveig Grewe.   Clarke also suggests that female motorists research a brand before investing in a new car. “There are many quality surveys into automotive brands. JP Power conducts some especially authoritative and respected research. This will tell you if the brand you’re buying boasts good or bad quality,” she notes.  But, when all is said and done,it’scritical to not only feel safe, but also comfortable – mentally and physically – in your car. How can you achieve this?  “My advice? Test drive the car! Drive it on your usual roads, load it up, park it in places you regularly visit. The main factor for me is your personal opinion – how does the car make you feel and, importantly, does it meet your mobility needs?” advises Sabrina Parant, WWCOTY jury member for Belgium.  So, there you have it. Maybe the most important factors to consider when buying a car aren’tthat different to when considering a life partner. Does the car make you smile? Is it known for its reliability? Does it make your heart beat that little bit faster? Then maybe it’s the car for you. "

        "content": "Despite the ongoing shift towards gender equality in society as a whole, there are still a number of disparities and myths regarding women. Some of these continue to pervade the motor industry, often in bad jokes about women being poor drivers.Many people also think that women only care about safety when it comes to choosing a vehicle. While a survey conducted by Good Housekeeping and JD Power, back in 2004, found that safety is most women’s number one concern, there is significant overlap between what men and women look for in a car, with women placing emphasis on comfort and value.Women aren’t overly concerned about what a car looks like, either. In fact, a study conducted by BuyaCar.co.uk found that women are more practical, while men tend to care more about their car’s image.Furthermore, the Good Housekeeping survey found that women actually cared more about acceleration and responsive handling than men. This continues to be true almost two decades later.“Women’s World Car of the Year (WWCOTY) results show that women want the same things everyone wants in a car – durability and reliability,” says Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women Insurance. “The winner in 2021 was the decidedly unisex Land Rover Defender, chosen for its technology and comfort, while last year, the jury selected the stylish Peugeot 308.” The WWCOTY jury consists of 63 female automotive journalists from 45 countries.Charleen Clarke, who represents South Africa on the WWCOTY jury, echoes this sentiment: “We certainly aren’t looking for a ‘woman’s car’ – there’s no such thing. Cars are not gender-specific and this is truer today than ever before. We look at the full gambit, from performance, driving dynamics, and safety, to quality, price, design, and environmental footprint. With the Peugeot 308, we were particularly impressed with its versatility, handling, and the performance of the 1.2-litre engine.”Clarke says that there is sometimes a tendency in the media to either patronise women drivers, or to believe that all they are interested in is safety. “A lot of marketing is focused on the ‘mother hen’ aspect of family safety when targeting a female audience,” Clarke points out. “Of course, women worry about safety, but we are just as concerned with features like fuel consumption, acceleration, handling, and environmental impact.”Van Wyngaard agrees, pointing out that 80% of car-buying decisions are influenced by women, including decisions on servicing and maintenance. “Advertising and marketing in the motor industry frequently have a lot of catching up to do when it comes to striking the right chord with women drivers. Marketers would do well to consider what a car represents to potential women buyers,” she suggests.Marketers should also heed the research that has shown women to be safer drivers than men, speeding less and braking less suddenly. Nicci Scott, founder of the Commercial Transport Academy, believes that – while gender alone is not a reliable predictor of driving ability – the myths purporting that women are bad drivers do not stack up to her extensive experience.“I work with female drivers on a daily basis, training them to become truck and bus drivers. Based on my many years of experience, statistical analysis from insurance underwriters and feedback from operators, I can state without a doubt that women are far better drivers than men and can even be considered superior drivers. This is partially due to the fact that they’re more meticulous and cautious. It’s also because they really focus on the task at hand,” she notes.Clarke notes that cars also mean different things to men and women. “If you think historically about what a vehicle represents, for men, a car is often a status symbol representing their importance or influence. Of course, we are concerned with the practical aspects of a car, but for many women, there’s another layer. Take, for instance, women gaining the right to drive in Saudi Arabia in 2018. It is clear that, with women’s rights gaining momentum and the gender gap shrinking, cars represent independence, freedom, and the chance to direct our own destinies,” she points out.It is also abundantly clear that – when it comes to motoring – women no longer need to play second fiddle.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Which is the best car in the world – according to women? It’s the Kia Niro, which has just been selected as the 2023 Women\"s World Car of the Year.The winning car has been announced today – March 8 – on International Women\"s Day. The Niro was chosen by the Women’s World Car of the Year (WWCOTY) jury, which comprises 63 female motoring journalists from 43 countries across five continents.The winning car was chosen out of the six category winners in the 2023 competition, namely the Kia Niro (Best Urban Car), Jeep Avenger (Best Family SUV), Citroën C5 X (Best Large Car), Nissan X-Trail (Best Large SUV), Audi RS 3 (Best Performance Car) and Ford Ranger (Best 4x4).Marta Garcia, Executive President of WWCOTY, notes that picking a winner was no easy task. “This year\"s election was particularly difficult due to the excellent level of all the candidates. Each of the finalists had sufficient merit to win the trophy,\" she says.Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women, notes that the massive selection of vehicles means that it’s hard for female motorists to choose their ideal car too. “That is the reason why competitions such as this one are so important. The independent and expert judging team from all over the globe evaluates each vehicle before the scoring takes place. Their opinions can be trusted by women who are planning to make a sizeable financial commitment in a new car,” she notes.Aspects such as safety, quality, price, design, ease of driving, and environmental footprint, among others, are considered when casting the votes. But why did the Kia come up trumps?A global survey into female buying preferences, commissioned earlier this year by 1st for Women, found that when it comes to cars, safety is the single most important feature desired by women. Practicality, performance, and space tied in second place. And the Niro delivers all these qualities – in abundance.“This is a vehicle I would highly recommend to any man, woman or family due to its endless array of safety features, impressive warranty and spacious interior packed with modern technology. What mother or father wouldn\"t feel safe driving their children around in a Kia Niro,” notes Alix Capper-Murdoch, who represents the Republic of Cyprus and Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the WWCOTY jury.Elana Scherr, who represents the USA, concurs. “The Kia Niro delivers a complete package that is clearly worthy of this award. Its numerous powertrain options, stylish design, easy-to-use technology, comfortable seating and budget-friendly packaging make it stand out among a field of fierce competition,” she says.The 1st for Women survey established the importance of practicality and space to women. This comes as no surprise; features such as space are essential to female buyers, especially moms. Many of the WWCOTY judges say that the Niro scores highly when it comes to these factors. Solveig Grewe, who represents Germany, reckons that the Niro deserved to win thanks to the fact that it is spacious and practical. Petra Mühr, who represents Austria, agrees: \"The Kia Niro is a spacious, stylish, efficient and practical car that is right on trend with its size, design and drive,” she notes.Sabrina Parant, who represents Belgium, says that the Niro is the latest in a long line of impressive Kia vehicles. “Kia continues to impress me... After the EV 6 and Sportage models, the Kia Niro offers a flexible vehicle, an attractive design, quality/luxury and a range of engines where all drivers can match their mobility needs. I especially appreciate the comfortable space and the technology,” she enthuses.The Niro is not currently available in South Africa. “There are no immediate plans to launch Niro in South Africa. We have ordered test/homologation units which are expected soon, whereafter a decision will be made,” says Christo Valentyn, Head of Marketing at Kia South Africa.However, Charleen Clarke, who represents South Africa on the WWCOTY jury, says that local female motorists are still spoilt for choice when shopping for a car – and she’s a big fan of the Audi RS 3, which was named WWCOTY’s Best Performance Car.“As a woman, when I buy a car, I insist on a vehicle that is both safe and practical. I would strongly recommend that other female motorists do the same; safety is vitally important – especially in South Africa. However, I also want a car that personifies enjoyment. It needs to be an absolute blast to drive. Its road manners must be exemplary and, every time I go for a drive, I need to do so with a smile on my face. The Audi RS 3 is such a car,” she reveals.Van Wyngaard believes that another finalist will find favour with female motorists in South Africa. “Women like a birds eye view – and this is offered by the Ford Ranger, which was awarded Best 4x4 by the WWCOTY. The Ranger doesn’t just have that much-desired seating position though. It also scores highly when it comes to the most sought-after other features by women, namely safety, practicality, performance, and space,” she concludes.• WWCOTY voting was verified by Grant Thornton, Auckland, New Zealand. This auditor has certified the WWCOTY results since its inception in 2009."

        "content": "What do women want?  That’s a question that’s baffled many minds but when it comes to cars, we have the answer.  A global survey, commissioned by South African insurer 1st for Women with members of the global Women’s World Car of the Year (WWCOTY) jury found that when it comes to cars, safety is the single most important feature desired by women. Practicality, performance, and space tied in second place. These features are generally to be found in abundance in the 2023 WWCOTY category winners, announced today*.  Best Urban Model:                  Kia NiroBest Family SUV:                   Jeep AvengerBest Large Car:                      Citroën C5 XBest Large SUV:                     Nissan X-TrailBest Performance Car:           Audi RS 3Best 4x4:                                 Ford Ranger “The WWCOTY finalists represent excellence in their segments based on safety, driving, comfort, technology, design, efficiency, impact on the environment and value for money,” says Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women.  The WWCOTY jurors have highlighted other feature that are also important for women: “I recently conducted a survey into the most wanted automotive features by women and around 14 000 female motorists participated. The outcome was that safety features and the seating position (the higher, the better) are extremely important to women,” says Tina Vujanović, who represents Serbia on the jury. Solveig Grewe, who represents Germany on the jury, says women want cars with great handling and lots of space. “This is followed in terms of importance by an armada of modern assistance systems,” she said. Many of the jurors note that women are looking for a vehicle that is practical and best suits their daily needs. “Women look for practicality. For instance, are the dashboards easy to read? Is there room for a child seat in the back? Is the boot big enough to handle grocery shopping and golf clubs? Can the boot cover be reached without having to stretch? Those sorts of things are important to women,” says Sandy Myhre, who represents New Zealand on the jury and also founded WWCOTY. Nicole Wakelin, who represents the USA, agrees. “Women look for features that make day-to-day life easier. That’s not the same set of features for every woman. Those who commute want comfort and a responsive yet fuel-efficient car. Moms seek out room for the kids, all their stuff, and easy access to buckle squirming toddlers into car seats. It’s all about making life easier.” In a similar vein, Sabrina Parent, who represents Belgium on the jury, says women look for a functional vehicle. “Furthermore, elements such as safety and drivability are important. A point that is becoming more and more important is the environmental aspect,” she says. Charleen Clarke, who represents South Africa on the jury, concurs. “Female motorists are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of cars. Accordingly, women are studying emission data and, where possible, they’re selecting a ‘greener’ motoring option.” Sara Soria, who represents Spain on the jury, says environmental considerations are really coming to the fore amongst female motorists in her home country. “In Spain, cars are classified according to an environmental label (Zero, Eco, C or B). It is now highly valued whether a car has the Zero label (electric cars and plug-in hybrids) or the Eco label (hybrids, mild hybrids and gas cars). Furthermore, on 1 January this year, a regulation came into force that obliges municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants to establish a low-emission zone and ban the most polluting vehicles from that zone,” she reveals. van Wyngaard comments that it’s highly likely that South African women would echo the motoring desires of their global counterparts – and rate safety tops. “In South Africa, safety – both active and passive features – is massively important to women. I say this for two reasons. Firstly, there is our abysmal road safety record. Secondly, there is the issue of personal safety. In another survey we conducted with 6500 South African women, we found that 91% feel unsafe while driving,” she points out. Given these findings, it’s no surprise that according to AutoTrader, the solid and spacious Toyota Hilux is the car most searched for by South African women. The VW Golf is the second most popular car amongst female motorists, while the Mercedes-Benz C-Class occupies the third podium position.

It is also a very practical and functional vehicle – and these traits are important to female motorists.” *WWCOTY FINALISTS: The Kia Niro impressed the jury because it is spacious, practical, safe, easy to drive, with several eco-friendly powertrains available. Furthermore, it has very low fuel consumption. The Avenger – Jeep\"s first 100% electric vehicle – got the thumbs up thanks to its very successful design and excellent off-road capability. The Citroën C5 X was a hit with the jury because it offers exceptional comfort, lots of space and a very attractive design. The Nissan X-Trail, on the other hand, garnered the jurors’ votes thanks to the fact that it is a large SUV with plenty of interior space and the option of seven seats. According to the jury, it is efficient over challenging terrain, and it is offered with Nissan\"s e-power technology, a hybrid solution in which the electric motor is the only engine that works as a propulsion system thanks to the energy provided by a petrol engine to the battery. The Audi RS 3 impressed the jury thanks to the fact that it is a very sporty model that incorporates all the technology that Audi has developed in circuit racing while the Ford Ranger was the top-scoring 4x4 thanks to the fact that it is a reliable, stylish and charismatic bakkie that can conquer any terrain. It\"s as efficient as an off roader, but more practical thanks to its cargo box, the jury noted."

To ensure that they’re comfy in a confined space, it’s advisable to get them used to it beforehand. Let them sit inside and explore the kennel or crate but don’t close or lock the door.Put a familiar item inside the kennel or crate. Things like their blanket or an item of your clothing will help keep them calm and content.Make sure that nothing obstructs the ventilation of the kennel or crate – don’t add any excess or bulky items.Pets tend to travel well. That’s why it’s important that they stay alert. Ensure that they aren’t too heavily sedated or tranquilised. Consult your vet for the right dosage.Make sure your pet is well hydrated and hasn’t eaten for at least four hours before departure.If you’re planning a road trip with your pet, here are some practical tips:2Make sure their dog/cat tags are up to date.Pack their vaccine record.Make a dedicated and comfy spot just for them.Reward them with treats to reinforce good behaviour.Always have water available for them.Stop for regular bathroom breaks (make sure to choose safe spots).Keep them occupied with toys.Bring a crate along in case you need it for hotel stays.Try camping, when you can, to give your pet more place to roam.Make sure your destinations are pet friendly.Never leave your pet alone in the car.Always pick up after your pet.So, there you have it, practical tips for travelling with your pets.

        "content": "The COVID Pandemic changed countless lives. It was a time of fear, loss, hardship and uncertainty. But out of it came many stories of survival, bravery and reinvention. Plant-based food brand Myra is one such story. Owner Tashia Naidoo Reddy had to sink or swim. She tells media personality Uveka Rangappa how she Fearlessly followed her passion to venture into something new in what was one of the scariest times the world has ever faced. 1.Starting a new business in the middle of a terrifying pandemic must have been daunting? What was your first Fearless moment?Definitely, the initial phase of the business when no one knew about Myra and were sceptical about our products. There was one specific moment which will always stand out for me – it was the first time I approached a major retailer to stock our vegan range.I was shunned almost immediately as if I was just wasting their time but I persisted. It was extremely difficult to convince a major retailer to carry a product that hadn’t been around for long. I eventually convinced them to take the products without any payment obligation. It wasn\"t long before the products had sold and I was asked to deliver another order. My fearful moment became one of triumph! 2.What were you doing before that and why the change?I was and still am involved in my first business which is Royal Gel-ly Mobile Spa &amp; Wellness. At the height of the pandemic, that business came to a grinding halt. I then knew I had to stir up the courage to not give up. As the saying goes - \"You get in life what you have the courage to ask for\". And so, I did... 3. Why Myra?Myra in Sanskrit means \"Gift of God \".  A true depiction of the brand vision. And for this reason, I believe Myra to be the perfect name. God has provided an earth filled with plants for humans to use as our food source, oxygen, medicine and overall fuel for life. 4. What did it take to go out and do this?It took a lot of hard work, dedication and perseverance. Being a perfectionist by nature I know I had to do whatever it took to ensure brand excellence. However, it came with rejection, insults and humiliation. But I didn\"t allow that to get to me. I wasn’t about to let go of my dream and I didn’t take my eye off the goal. I have also been blessed with the most supportive spouse and family to whom I owe my ultimate success.  5. It sounds like this is more than a business for you – it’s a passion. Tell us about that?It is certainly more than a business to me. At the age of seven, I gave up eating meat completely and became vegetarian. I grew up in a predominantly vegetarian/vegan family. So, this has been our way of life for as long as I know. In the past, very few brands have offered vegetarian/vegan  options, making it exceptionally difficult to thoroughly enjoy day-to-day meals. So, we had to create ways to make meals more enjoyable and nutritious. I am undoubtedly living my passion. \"The only way to do great work is to love what you do\". 6. “Food businesses” like this have been popping up all over, how do you stay ahead and make your business stand out?Veganism has undeniably gained traction over the years with people becoming more aware of animal cruelty, the environment, how food is processed and mass production causing numerous health issues. This awareness was heightened with the COVID outbreak and theories of the virus possibly originating from bats. There are many brands which now offer vegan products, but they ignore the nutritional side. They merely make meat mock-ups which lack good healthy ingredients. At Myra, we source only the best ingredients, infused with all the superfood goodness. 7. Customers can also be very difficult when it comes to food.  How do you deal with that?Well, the customer is always right!  We do our best to always satisfy our customers’ needs but we can’t please everyone. However, unhappy customers are our greatest source of learning. It gives us the opportunity to touch people\"s lives in some small yet significant way and become better as a brand. 8. What next for Tashia or Myra?We want to expand our range with many more exciting, wholesome products including ready-made meals for the busy individual, without compromising on nutrition. We want to go nationwide and then take on the world! "

        "description": "",
        "content": " What do countries with the best coronavirus responses have in common? Leaders who are women.  There are countless scientific studies to explain why this is the case, most recently, a study by Harvard Business Review which found that women tend to outperform men when it comes to leadership. We’re all familiar with the term ‘glass ceiling’ and are constantly being encouraged to shatter it, A lesser-known term is ‘glass cliff’ which refers to the phenomenon of women being more likely than men to be promoted to leadership roles during periods of crisis or downturn, when the chance of failure is highest.  The theory is that women possess certain traits that make them better able to navigate through tough times. They’re seen as more empathetic, more flexible, better team players, stronger communicators, with higher EQ.  If this is the case, then why do women make up only 33.1% of managerial positions in South Africa? Siegie Brownlee, Executive Director of Eduvos, one of South Africa’s largest independent private higher education institutions, that has recently launched a fully-accredited Women in Leadership qualification, explains: “While some are born to be leaders, much of what it takes to be one can be learned. But, according to a study conducted in the UK by the New Street Consulting Group, women have identified that they feel less supported by their organisations than men in developing their leadership skills.  The Eduvos Women in Leadership course has been designed to address this and inspire confidence – the confidence to recognise and attain their worth and navigate the unpredictable and complex world of work.” In a recent panel discussion hosted by Eduvos and 1st for Women Insurance experts weighed in on how woman could overcome these setbacks: “Be honest with yourself where you are financially. Don\"t fake it until you make it. Work according to your zone of genius.”“Women have played a vital role in the development of our country.  My message to woman is - never let anyone deter you from what you are destined to be.”“Set boundaries – we are living in demanding times where the lines between work and personal lives are blurred.  Achieving balance can be very challenging.  Strive for work integration, not work balance.”“Women have all the qualities they need to reach the top – all that’s left to do is change their narrative from one of fear, to one of fearlessness.  Being fearless is both a decision and an action. It doesn’t mean living a life devoid of fear but living a life in which our fears don’t hold us back.  It’s the audacity to be unhindered by failure or judgement, and to walk with freedom, strength and hope in the face of things unknown.  It’s about controlling that voice in your head that says you’re not enough. Because you are.”“Be a mentor – fight the battle of your sisters and have their back.”“There\"s no such thing as multi-tasking. It\"s about efficiency - priority vs importance. Ask yourself what your life is by design. What shapes you?”“We are all in the same boat as we sail through stormy seas - we must keep our heads up high and remember that it is hard, but it is doable.”“What I took away from running my own business is hustling - know when to work and when to rest.  Have the courage to reinvent yourself. Take the dive to rise again. Be willing to constantly learn and evolve.”“Share the value of empathy, kindness, and altruism.  It does not matter where you are coming from, it matters where you are going and the impact you have in people’s lives.” Your gender does not rule you out from having a seat at the table, in fact you deserve to sit at the head which is your rightful place.

        "content": "Spring has sprung and with it, the promise of fresh beginnings and renewal. It’s time to burst open your windows, and while less exciting, open your cleaning supplies cupboards for an annual spring clean and declutter. The new season is also the perfect time to spring clean your outlook to make room for what truly matters most. It’s a time to take stock of what nourishes you and what nurtures your growth. Out with the old and in with the new.Here are 10 spring cleaning strategies you can start right now:Begone workplace blues:  Consistently high stress levels, too much screen time and lack of proper sleep all take their toll in the long run. Take micro-breaks during your workday and step away from your computer and phone. Set a non-negotiable cut-off time for work and make sure that you get a solid seven to eight hours’ sleep.Break bad financial habits:  Make sure that you don’t live beyond your means, providing for what you need first and what you want last. Make a proactive effort to save money and set aside a certain amount, every month. A good rule of thumb is to save up an emergency fund that could last you three months, should you lose your income.Clean up your relationships:  The people you choose to surround yourself with can make or break you. Rid yourself of any relationship that takes more energy and joy than it gives.Know your worth (then add tax):  Choose to surround yourself with people who love, value, inspire, energise and empower you.Toss out self-doubt:  The internal battle of self-doubt is a major barrier to success. Make a list of things that get you down, disqualify things that simply aren’t true, change the things that you can and work on accepting those you can’t.Get out there:  Life is there to be lived. Have a goal? Start working towards it. Make a target-driven to do list with specific mini-goals and definite timelines to achieve your main goal. You’ve got this.Stop procrastinating:  Write down a list of all the tasks you need to accomplish – both short-term and long-term. Having this record will help when planning the various actions needed to achieve these tasks.Reflect on the year:  How are things going? What’s not working? What do you need to let go of? What can you do differently for the next four months?Toss what doesn’t make you feel amazing:  As decluttering guru, Marie Kondo, says: the best way to find out what we really need is to get rid of what we don’t. So, toss (or rather, donate) that which doesn’t bring you joy.Polish your attitude:  Shift your attention from all that is going wrong in your life to all that is going right. Gratitude should always trump negativity. Spring time is prime time to reassess, refocus and re-equip yourself, make that change, kick that bad habit, terminate that toxic relationship and take on that new mountain… and the time to start is right NOW.

        "content": "This Women\"s Month, 1st for Women has teamed up with speaker, trainer and author, Lori Milner, to bring you The Ultimate Guide To Showing Up To Yourself in Life &amp; Business.  Want to build new habits and actually sustain them?  Want to manage your inner critic, free of anxiety and fear?  Lori has the answers. Last week we discussed celebrating your win and aiming for progress.  If you haven’t read this blog post, you can do so here.  Today, we’ll list some more tools needed to show up to yourself in life and business.  Starting with:  Don’t wait to feel like it  When it comes to a new goal/habit/hobby, there is a story you have told yourself that you need to feel like doing it to take action. Here’s the truth – you will never feel like doing it. You cannot wait for this magic burst of inspiration and motivation to do the activity you scheduled for yourself. Have you ever heard of having ‘Runners Block’? There’s a reason for that. They get onto the road whether they feel like it or not and just run. How do you move through this barrier?Make the decision the night before and allow no room for debate. In this way, you will not need to rely on willpower or motivation. Benjamin Hardy, author of Willpower Doesn’t Work: Discover the Hidden Keys to Success says:  ‘To be frank, willpower is for people who haven’t decided what they actually want in their lives. If you’re required to exert willpower to do something, there is an obvious internal conflict. You want to eat the cookie, but you also want be healthy. You want to focus at work, but you also want to watch that YouTube video. You want to be present with your kids, but you can’t stop looking at your phone. You don’t know what you want and are thus internally conflicted. Your desire (your why) for your goals isn’t strong enough. You aren’t invested in yourself and your dreams.’ Marketing Guru, Joe Polish, says he does 50 burpees a day. He claims that he hates doing them, but he loves the feeling of having done 50 burpees a day. How about reframing your mindset to how you will feel after having achieved the micro win? The problem with waiting to feel like it is that ultimately you will land up avoiding the task and breaking the agreement with yourself because you weren’t ‘feeling inspired or creative or energised’ that day. This causes havoc on your confidence and self-esteem and catapults you into a downward spiral for the day resulting in procrastination and choices that are not in your own best interest.    2. USE FEAR AS A COMPASS A huge barrier to taking action and showing up to ourselves is fear. It could be the fear of failure, fear of not being good enough or the fear of not being perfect that prevents us from taking action on what matters most to us. Your brain is hard-wired for protection, but there aren’t any Sabretooth tigers anymore – it’s protecting you from the feeling of discomfort that comes with doing something new and moving out of your comfort zone. You like the known even if it’s not always best for you. This is the reason why you may be holding onto old habits, thoughts and patterns that no longer serve you.When you are forming these new neural pathways, the new way of doing things, there will inevitably be feelings of anxiety and uneasiness.Have you ever used Waze or Google Maps to take you somewhere new, and there’s this reflex not to want to trust the technology? Like you know better? But you have no choice other than to trust this different route than you would usually take, and you land up discovering a better route, which ultimately becomes your new normal. Similarly, you need to trust yourself to discover the new route – this new way of being - until it becomes your new normal. For example, suppose you are training yourself to wake up 30 minutes earlier. In that case, it’s going to be uncomfortable at first but eventually, when you do it for long enough, your body adjusts, and it becomes the new body clock. Fear is a compass, and you need to run towards it. If you think about something you did for the first time like presenting to your team, it was daunting, but you did it. I’m sure you had the same initial feelings of angst, but in time you mastered it. When it comes to creating new actions, remind yourself that it’s another one of those.Next week, we’ll discuss more ways in which you can show up to yourself in life &amp; business. Until then remember, of you genuinely want to let go of the old version of yourself, you need to ask yourself some tough questions: Am I willing to go through the discomfort of doing things differently?Am I willing to let go of old destructive or out of date habits and thoughts that no longer serve me?"

        "content": "Did you know that there are 21 weeks left of the year from the 9th of August? With this in mind we’re embarking on a campaign that we have so fittingly named “2021st for Women”. During the next 21 weeks, we’re going to celebrate 21 fearless women and their fearless firsts.   From the likes of actress, writer, activist and performance poet Lebogang Mashile to YOU. We’ll be celebrating firsts no matter how small or big they are.We often look at women who have done things that we deem incredible and we’re in awe of them and instantly feel an injection of inspiration. It is in this very moment that we need to look within and celebrate our own wins.Celebrating a first does not necessarily have to be the first time you performed heart surgery (we’d love to hear about this if that’s the case) but, it can be the first time you led a presentation, signed a lease, stood up for yourself or figured something out on your own.All to often we wait for the big wins before we celebrate ourselves, forgetting that those big wins are made up of all the small victories you achieve daily.The rest of 2021 is about celebrating firsts, as woman we are going to be each other’s and our own loudest cheerleaders.To share your fearless 1st or a 1st that you think deserves to be recognised, head over to our social media platforms leave a comment and #fearless1st.We can’t wait to hear your stories and form part of a community that celebrates you."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Keeping you safe is important to us, that’s why we make it our priority to inform you of any information that can help keep you and your car safe.The Insurance Crime Bureau (ICB) recently issued a car recall scam alert following a resurgence in the number of cases.What is the car recall scam? Criminals execute a recall scam by contacting unsuspecting car owners while posing as officials representing a car manufacturer. They convince the owners that their car is part of a batch being recalled due to some or other malfunction or mechanical issue. With the promise of a repaired or replacement car, many people buy into this scam. The ICB says that initial contact is normally made telephonically, where a criminal posing as an official informs victims that their car is being recalled. This is often followed up with a spoof e-mail to make arrangements to collect the car with a tow truck. A couple of days later, the owner would typically phone the dealership for an update, only to discover that the car has in fact been stolen. Tips to avoid becoming a victim: Limit the amount of personal information you share on social media and telephonically. Criminals use this to build a detailed profile of their victims.Be vigilant and maintain a healthy sense of scepticism when talking to strangers. Make every effort to verify that they are indeed who they say they are, and that they are an employee of the company they claim to represent.Check with the manufacturer and/or dealership directly to verify that the recall is legitimate. Don’t trust contact details provided by the person who called you.It is very unlikely that the manufacturer will send a tow truck to collect your car – in most cases they will expect you to bring your car to them.Report any suspicious calls to the authorities, the manufacturer and/or the dealership. Furthermore, there has been an increase in higher value cars being targeted in hijackings largely attributed to syndicate operations using the blue light robbery technique. What is the blue light robbery technique? This refers to a method where criminals impersonate law enforcement officials in order to commit hijackings – it is also known as blue light robberies. If you are in such a situation, where an unmarked car with a flashing blue light is trying to force you to pull over, you should: Immediately switch on your hazard lights to acknowledge the person trying to pull you over, indicate that they should follow you and drive to the nearest police station or a busy public area. What to do following the theft of your car If you have a car-tracking device installed, immediately call your tracking company to report the theft.Report it to the SAPS and file a stolen car report within 48 hours.Make sure you have the car details: model, colour, car identification and registration numbers etc. available to assist with the identification and recovery of the car.Report your claim to your insurance company. If your car is stolen after hours, call your insurance company on the next working day. Stay safe, remember we’re a touch of a button away when you need us on the App, download the app now. "

        "content": "In honour of Father’s Day, we asked the dads of 1st for Women about their own experiences – and what being a Fearless Father means to them. We were inspired by their honest and heartwarming responses. We think you’ll be too! Here are just some of the wonderful insights they shared… “To be a Fearless Father means changing the narrative of fatherhood and changing the perception of how the South African Fathers are sometimes perceived. A Fearless Father is always present in their children’s lives, during their joys and fears, always giving them the love and warmth they need and deserve. Fearless also means protecting them from any harm and being a hero to your kids.  It’s also important to create a healthy and a conducive environment for the kids to grow up fearless themselves and give them the necessary support to become the best that they can be.”Justice  “To be a Fearless Father takes: Ability to love, bravery to protect, courage to inspire, determination to support, emotional intelligence to forgive, faith to see beyond weaknesses, guts to say I apologise, humility of unmeasurable amount, inspiration for your children to be the best they can be, a joyous smile to your family in the midst of hardship, kindness to build and support, love to conquer obstacles for them…”Floyd  “With my own 3 children, I really see what I was taught by my father coming into play on a daily basis.  Being there for your children, loving them differently and in different ways, dealing with the daily squabbles, having those crucial conversations, having those dialogues with them, understanding their dreams and supporting them.” David “What it takes to be a fearless father? For me it is simple, just BEING THERE. If my boy is crying or irritated, I hold him – when he sees my face, he smiles and it gives me peace to know that he trusts me.  He feels at peace, safe and protected.”Manduleni “Fearless Fathers are willing to step up and face any fear, and do whatever it takes to live up to their fullest potential. It always feels good when you do anything within your power to protect your family. The reason why I wake up every day and go to work is because I had a dream long time ago that I want to be a good example to other fathers out there.”Ronewa   “Come fault and failure, slip, fall or collapse, with my last breath I give my life to be the kind of father my kids are proud to call Dad.”Dawood – single father of 3 \"I wouldn’t trade the title of being a Father for anything. From the sleepless nights, to turning a frown into a smile and being called Dad. I may not wear a cape or fancy mask but I’m definitely a hero in my son’s eyes.” Thulani “My kids come first and there is nothing I wouldn’t do for them. Seeing a smile on their face is what keeps me going.”Mpho "

        "content": "If you’re a mom, especially a new mom, you know ALL about this – from pregnancy dos and don’ts to new-born sleep training advice. And of course, the commentary and opinions on how you’re raising your child – from what you’re feeding them, to their developmental milestones, to their education. While some advice you welcome, other advice, not so much.This got us wondering what TVs funniest new mom, Tali Babes, had to say on the subject. So, we asked her and in typical Tali style, she gave us the raw, real and hilarious lowdown on her mothering journey so far.If you missed her hilarious retelling of all the ‘helpful’ advice she’s received, hit play and get ready to laugh and nod along!Not all mothering advice is unwelcomed however, some of it can be incredibly helpful and useful.We asked the fearless moms of 1st for Women to share some of the best advice they’ve received. Here’s what they had to say…The warm and heartfelt Vannadevi shares how the best advice she received was from her own mom: “The best advice my mom gave me is: ,always be yourself, be a woman of self-respect; always give respect, old or young in order for you to earn it in return and; never underestimate your own potential, find it, use it and enjoy it”Here’s the advice that resonated most with Khomotso:“I was advised to create a space where my kids feel comfortable coming to me with issues.  I need to be their first point of contact, not their friends or other family members BUT ME, THEIR MOM.”The invaluable advice from Lezelle’s late mom:“Instead of standing behind your kids to make sure they study and do their homework, rather put time and effort into nurturing another component of your child success and development. She believed that it is just as important, and even more essential to being a good person.”The light and funny Thamashni shares some of the comments that came her way… and her witty responses. “Isn’t he too young to start school.”Uhm… NO. Because it is actually good for him to socialise from a young age and I have things to do.“He shouldn’t be vegetarian. He won’t grow.” Since when was not eating meat a bad thing?! I have seen lots of tall, bulky vegetarians. And it is his choice – he doesn’t like meat.Wendy also had quick and quirky responses to the advice she got… “Keeping your children from throwing tantrums in public begins in the home.”My son had one tantrum in the shops. Never again as I threw myself down on the floor and did the same. He proceeded to say ‘no naughty mommy’ and helped me up.Mbali got us giggling with her take on mothering advice:“When my daughter was still young, she used to cry all the time and people would often say ‘she feels you’re tired, you should sleep when she sleeps’ as if it’s that simple OR ‘you should enjoy every moment, you’re lucky to have this opportunity.’ Gee, thanks Karen, I love my permanent eye bags.”The advice you wish you had gotten sooner We love this advice from Naseera:“Being a mum of three kids, I have received so much unsolicited mum advice. It’s also difficult when you want to be polite about the advice given, especially when you are a person like me with NO FILTER!My advice? You have to trust your instinct!!! Always.  Take what you get, don’t be rude, but always remember, it’s your child, your rules!” When in doubt, remember to breathe.  You’ve got this. And remember – silence is golden.  Except when you have kids – then silence is suspicious."

        "content": "If you’re planning on enjoying a relaxing staycation this Easter weekend, then keep reading. We’ve got a list of ideas that’ll keep you and your family occupied and entertained all weekend long.Here goes:1.Cook or bake up a storm with the kidsThis idea is a fun way to spend time with your kids and enjoy the fruits of your labour. Whether you decide to cook a whole meal together, bake your favourite Easter biscuits or just decorate a few eggs, you can bond, chat and laugh as you work your way around the kitchen.2. Games night funBoard games and card games are always good fun. From Monopoly and 30 Seconds to Pictionary, Risk and UNO, there are games that are suitable for every age and every family. Throw in some snacks and prizes and away you go.3. Movie night magicMovie nights are a great way to spend some time with your family, without having to fork out a fortune at the cinema. Let the kids choose their favourite movie or watch something that the whole family can enjoy. Pop some popcorn, get into your PJs and chill.4. Not just an ordinary dinner…Cooking the same meals day in and day out can get really boring. Use the time you have this weekend to come up with a theme and create a dinner. Then make sure you all dress the part. Need some ideas? What about a beach party, taco fiesta, French picnic or a Bohemian backyard braai?5. Easter egg huntChildren of all ages (the kid in you included!) will love a good old Easter egg hunt. To make it a little more challenging for older kids, turn it into a treasure hunt with clues. You could even time each person to see who figures their clue out the fastest.6. Have a YES! dayYou’re on holiday, so why not relax those rules a little and have a day of yesses instead of nos. Chocolate for breakfast? Staying in PJs all day? Eating in front of the TV? YES! YES! YES!7. Indulge in an at-home spa dayThere’s nothing more relaxing than a day at the spa. So why not recreate the experience at home? Make homemade masks and take turns giving each other a massage. Soak your feet, do each other’s nails and sip on water filled with chopped up fruit. Spending the day in your gown and slippers, while being pampered – now that’s like heaven!8. Be a tourist in your own cityJust because you’ve lived in your city forever, doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy it like a tourist. Grab your camera and backpack and enjoy the day exploring some of the sites you’ve never seen before.9. Take a hike – in a good way!Getting out into nature is always a good way to relax, unwind and enjoy the fresh air. Look for organised hikes in and around your area or take a long walk on the beach. The fresh air and sunshine will do you wonders.10. Enjoy a day tripSpend the day out and about. Visit the zoo, a park, the aquarium or just go for a drive and see where the road takes you.Spending quality time with your family at home can be so much fun. Try some of these ideas and snap a few pics along the way – and make this Easter weekend one you won’t forget."

        "content": "When the outside world is a no-go zone, South African women who have FOGO (Fear of Going Out) make a plan to keep themselves occupied and boredom at bay.In fact, according to recent research conducted by 1st for Women Insurance, 100% of the women surveyed took up a new hobby over the Covid-19 lockdown period and half of these women now practice this hobby every day.And it’s not just South African women who are learning new skills.  In the UK, a survey carried out by the country’s leading independent online florist Serenata Flowers, revealed that half of British women took up a new hobby since the pandemic began, with 67% practising it at least once a week.According to Seugnette van Wyngaard, Head of 1st for Women:  “In the survey, participants listed their newly acquired skill.  While the majority are busying themselves with arts and crafts, cooking, gardening and reading, others have taken up hobbies including learning British Sign Language, agility dog training, bobbin lace making and livestock photography.”Similar to what was observed in the UK survey, South African women found that there are major mental health benefits in learning a new skill. Half of the respondents said it makes them happy and 22% said it reduced stress. 65% of the women surveyed said their hobby made them feel more productive during this uncertain time.“Experts agree that a hobby can keep you mentally fit, stress-free and confident.  When you are focused and invested on a task, you forget your fears and worries and are able to re-establish control.  All important factors during these times,” says van Wyngaard.According to the survey, these are SA’s women’s top 10 lockdown hobbies:Arts &amp; Crafts                                     Gardening    Cooking Reading                                               Baking    Knitting/Crocheting                       Running/Jogging  Meditation                          Walking                                               "

        "content": "There is a beautiful saying by Winston Churchill – “We make a living by what we get but we make a life by what we give.” And in a year in which we’ve witnessed the power of giving like never before, the season of giving reminds us once again of the remarkable difference we can make. Whether it’s been through donations to COVID-19 relief or supporting small businesses, South Africans have rallied together in the most inspiring way. So, as the season of giving approaches, we look at some of the many ways you can give and give back this festive season.Give to the nursesWe’re inspired by the incredible nurses on the frontline – the women who risk their lives every day to put our safety, and the safety of our families, 1st. That’s why we partnered with Gift of the Givers, BackaBuddy and VULA Mobile to ensure that South African nurses, working tirelessly to fight the pandemic, are provided with the emotional support and protection they need. If you’d like to help us keep helping them, make a donation here.Pro-tip: Donate on a loved one’s behalf as a gift to them.Give to the fight against woman abuseHave you streamed/downloaded our My Body (Stand Up) song yet? Did you know that all proceeds go to the 1st for Women Foundation to fight woman abuse? You can also give in the form of time, skills and funds through our ForWomen initiative. Plus, if you join 1st for Women, a portion of your premiums is donated to the Foundation, which has raised R81 million to date for woman abuse causes and assisted over 90 000 survivors.Give to the elderly and vulnerableThere are many restrictions still in place when it comes to visiting old age homes and care centres, so if you cannot physically volunteer, why not put together a festive package for a home near you. And if you have a loved one at a care facility you can’t visit, why not create a holiday video with messages from the entire family? You can also arrange a group video call and celebrate together, virtually.Give to the childrenBring the magic of the holiday season to vulnerable children by contributing to homes and initiatives that are close to your heart – from Santa Shoe Box to Cotlands and CHOC, there are thousands of organisations you can support.Pro-tip: Donate to children’s charities on behalf of your loved ones.Give to the environmentWhile masks and hand santisers are essential for us, the resulting waste causes havoc to the environment. In addition to choosing reusable masks, see how you can reduce waste over the festive season – from sustainable gift wrapping to signing up for recycling services.Pro-tip: Know someone who loves to live green? Sign them up for a recycling service.Give to the animalsIf you’re an animal lover, there are numerous worthy causes who need support all year around. A great way to spend time outdoors, with the kids, is to volunteer at the SPCA or other animal NGOs, where you can walk dogs, pet cats and attend to the various other animals they care for. You can also contribute with monetary donations and pet food.Pro-tip: Know a pet lover? Donate to the SPCA on their behalf.Give a garment with meaningOur Fearless T-shirt co-designed by Palesa Mokubung (creator of the Mantsho brand) and our brand ambassador Zozibini Tunzi, makes a statement and makes a difference.

        "content": "The stresses and strains of mental anxiety that comes with being on the road can take a toll on your overall health. It’s common knowledge that stress brings on a high risk of cardiovascular disease, but listening to the right music while driving can calm you down, bring down the pulse rate, and help put you into a better mood.The best methods of listening Most vehicles have some form of sound system, however low- or high-tech it may be, but different methods offer different sound quality.Original CDs or compact discs – If your car was manufactured before 2010, it\"s likely you do not have AUX or Bluetooth capability. Still, CDs do offer a full and rich sound in the car, one disadvantage, however, is the tendency to jump when driving over bumpy surfaces. Bluetooth® transmitter – allows you to stream music to your stereo without a cable. As they are digital transmissions, they give you better sound quality over analogue transmissions like FM.Auxiliary input – The auxiliary input jack is a convenient way to listen to music from a mobile device like your smartphone. It delivers a direct signal from source to the car stereo without any electronic manipulations. This means your stereo receives exactly the same signal that your music source is creating letting you experience optimum sound quality.USB input – Your music played this way remains in digital format – what you hear is exactly what you have stored on your device, therefore you\"ll experience the best sound quality possible from an external source. Whichever method you use, bear in mind that for optimal sound quality, ensure your audio files are uncompressed with a high bit rate. The importance of musicIt\"s the universal languageIt creates ambience It unites people It enhances brain function and helps you focusIt puts you \"in the mood\"It lets your imagination flowIt improves your memoryIt gives us pleasure What types of music are best when driving? In a study to examine the influence music has on driver stress in traffic congestion, it was found that drivers who listened to their favourite self-selected music appeared to have lower stress levels than those who drove without listening to anything. However, music therapists might say that knowing a piece too well could also be counterproductive. Certain genres and instruments certainly contain the right musical elements for relaxation:Genres – Downtempo, classical, jazz, world, lounge, classic rock, soft pop, and ambient. Instruments – Native American, Celtic, Indian stringed-instruments, drums, and flutes.So, what’s the best music for driving? It may be different for everyone, but slow and simple seems to be the consensus. Why not explore a few to find melodies that work for you.For your car insurance and other insurance needs, get in touch with 1st for Women &amp; talk to an expert consultant today.Disclaimer: This content is for informational, educational, or entertainment purposes only.

        "content": "China and the United States are the two highest producers of CO2 in the world respectively. Steel, cement, mineral processing, and petrochemical manufacturing are among the dirtiest industries in China, and much of what is produced in these industries is exported to our country. Everyday items like beauty products and disposable nappies account for a great deal of environmental waste and pollution because of their manufacturing processes.Similarly, the US is a major exporter of motor vehicle parts and poultry products to South Africa, costing our economy billions to bring these items in.But many of us need these items in our day-to-day lives, so how are we supposed to conserve the environment and get by? One small way to make a big difference is to buy local products. By doing this, you can stop many items from being shipped and airfreighted, thereby reducing your carbon footprint. In addition, because local products are often not produced on such a mass scale, there is less chance of funny ingredients ending up in them. And, every time you buy from a local entrepreneur, you’re helping that person, their family, and the country’s economy. That’s why local truly is lekker!Here are some ideas of products you can buy locally that will make a world of difference to our environment. 1. Cloth nappies The average child will use nearly one ton of disposable nappies by the time they are potty trained, all of which will end up polluting our lands and oceans. Cloth nappies are an excellent way to have a meaningful impact on pollution reduction.There are many myths and misconceptions around cloth nappies, like how they’re difficult to use and hard to clean. But gone are the days of the old terry towel nappies that needed hours of soaking and scrubbing by hand. Today, modern cloth nappies come in all shapes, sizes, materials, patterns, and colours. Many of them are as easy to use as disposables and require no more than a quick rinse and machine wash to clean. Let’s do a quick comparison between disposables and cloth nappies. The average child will use between 4 000 and 5 000 disposable nappies before potty training. In comparison, that same child could get by on just 54 cloth nappies until they are potty trained if you wash them every second day. If you’re willing to wash every day, you will need just 27 nappy changes from birth to potty trained.The costs associated with disposable nappies are exorbitant too, with an average cost of over R13 000 over 30 months. A budget stash of cloth nappies, however, can cost just R2 500 over the same period of time. Not only do cloth nappies help the environment and help create a better world for the children who use them, but they also save budgets.Another bonus of using cloth nappies is you can support local entrepreneurs. There are many local work-at-home moms (or WAHMs) who rely on the income they receive from their cloth nappy businesses to support their families.Learn more about women leading the way in tech and business2. FoodIn 2018, the United States exported $371 million worth of agricultural, fish, and forestry products to South Africa. This includes poultry meat, planting seeds, tree nuts, and beef – all items available in our own country. It’s true that local produce can sometimes be more expensive, but it ultimately costs our country less economically to support local farmers.One way to buy local produce is to get fruit and vegetables that are in season. Those available out of season are almost certainly imported from overseas.3. Beauty productsMany of your favourite beauty brands are made in China and imported to South Africa, including Maybelline, Essence, Revlon, Forever 21 Beauty, and more. Over the years, scandals have rocked the make-up world where products made in China were found to contain ingredients like asbestos, high amounts of lead, and mercury. So not only can it be bad for the environment, it could be bad for you and your loved ones in your home. Buying from a local beauty brand means there’s less chance of encountering dangerous ingredients because products aren’t manufactured on such a large scale. We have so many amazing local beauty brands that use only healthy, natural ingredients. Why not try them out?4. Cars While there isn’t exactly an abundance of local car brands, there are plenty that manufacture locally, including Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, and Mercedes-Benz. Buying a car that is locally made means that car never needed to be transported by ship to South Africa. At most, it’s taken a journey via truck across our country, which is better for the environment. It also means you’re helping people working in these factories to keep their jobs. Plus, it’s often more affordable to buy a locally manufactured vehicle because it’s cheaper to service and repair them, which can lead to lower car insurance premiums. So more savings for you and your family.5. TextilesCheap imported clothing from other countries may seem attractive, but it comes at a price – one less immediately noticeable but nevertheless more damaging. These imports have had a negative effect on our own textile industry, where many local clothing designers and manufacturers are struggling to get by. It also takes money that could be spent on our own economy and puts it into another country’s. But let’s be honest, most people can’t afford more expensive clothing, which local items often are. Rather than going all-or-nothing, why not commit to buying one locally-made item of clothing every three months? It might not seem like a lot, but when it comes to saving the environment, every little bit helps. And you’ll be helping a fellow South African make a living and support their family. You might also find that locally made products are simply better quality because they aren’t produced on a mass scale. Buying local has so many positive side effects. It’s good for the environment, our economy, yourself, and your loved ones. Now that you know how easy it is to support local entrepreneurs, you’ll look for ways to do it every day!Sources: SACNU; Love to Know; Medium; US Trade Numbers; USTR"

        "description": "",
        "content": "We don’t know when the COVID-19 pandemic will end when our children will return to school as normal, when every industry is once again up and running, or when we can freely take a holiday and visit our loved ones.What we do know is that the world will never be the same after the Coronavirus pandemic is over. For a long time to come – perhaps forever – we’ll be wearing masks when we’re sick, sanitising our hands and shopping baskets, and maintaining a wary distance from strangers in public, even when the virus is no longer such a threat.In this rapidly changing world, it’s important to equip our children with skills that are necessary to not only survive in a post-COVID-19 world but to thrive. We know it’s already difficult for many parents to find the time to teach their children school work, but many of these skills are either already taught in school or are taught as part of their everyday upbringing. Here are some of the skills your children will need as they progress through school and into the working world.Digital dexterityIn September 2019, CareerJunction released a jobs index report which showed that digital skills, like software development, are among the most in-demand in South Africa. It’s been clear for years that digital skills are a must for upcoming generations to possess. With the Coronavirus outbreak, having these kinds of skills is more important than ever. Children need the computer and cyber skills necessary to, at the very least, attend school (and later work) remotely. This is probably not the last time our world will face a pandemic of this proportion, and many companies are now considering permanent work-from-home set-ups, so remote working is only going to increase.In South Africa, this is even more important because so many learners don’t have access to computers or the internet, and without these, they can’t learn these essential digital skills. For some, programming will set them on the path to a successful career, while for others, learning the basics, like how to use a laptop or Mac, Microsoft Office, and access the internet, could change the course of their lives. Where possible, encourage your children to take subjects at school that relates to digital prowess, whether that’s basic computer literacy or computer programming.Learn more about Self-acceptance during the time of COVID-19 and beyondVocational virtuosityWhile remote working and digital skills are going to be more important than ever, so are vocational skills. During the Coronavirus pandemic, we’ve seen just how vital front-line workers are in keeping us healthy and help make our lives as normal as possible. From retail staff, to medical professionals, to at-home caregivers, these are the unsung heroes who keep the wheel turning. Children should be encouraged to study trade skills and be taught that there is a lot of pride to be had in performing these essential jobs.Mindfulness mattersThis is a tough skill for adults to learn, let alone children. Studies have shown that people touch their faces anywhere between 16 and 23 times per hour without even realising it. Because many viruses – including COVID-19 – are contracted through the eyes, nose, and mouth, this unconscious habit is one we all need to mindfully combat. As hard as it is, it’s important your children are aware of their bodies and make a conscious effort not to touch their faces.Mindfulness also refers to a mental state where you focus on your awareness of the present moment and acknowledge your thoughts and feelings. In such a chaotic and stressful world, this is a useful skill for children to have. it helps to relieve anxiety in stressful situations and develop coping skills in our fast-paced and uncertain world.Learn more about dealing with your kids’s corona anxiety.Soft skillsOften underrated, having soft skills can get an individual far in their schooling and working career. These include communication skills, time management, people skills, and creative thinking. If you thought it was hard to have a constructive meeting at the office, having one over Zoom is even more challenging. The natural conversation and turn-taking that happens when people meet face-to-face don’t flow as easily in an online meeting room. And without body language, it’s much harder to read another person’s attitude and demeanour. Children will need to learn and re-learn soft skills that enable them to effectively work on their own and communicate with others while isolated. They need to be able to manage their time and get all their tasks done at home where there are often more distractions and no one to help them focus.Soft skills are also important because once they’ve been taught, they can be applied in any role or job. A software developer who works behind a computer needs people skills as much as a customer service agent who deals with the public because communicating effectively with colleagues will be more important than ever. Perhaps the most important soft skills of all are adaptability and resilience. In such a rapidly changing world, where we are all facing something we’ve never faced before, being able to adapt to and overcome your circumstances is vital to thriving.Multitasking mastersEven before COVID-19, our country’s unemployment rate was high. Now, with so many businesses retrenching or closing down entirely, work is going to be even harder to come by. It’s important for children to learn multiple skills that can enable them to take on any number of roles, so they can get work wherever they can. At the same time, they might need to be able to do more than one job at a time just to put food on the table, so being able to multitask will be essential in the post-Coronavirus world.There is so much uncertainty in the world right now, but we can be confident that our lives as we know them won’t ever be quite the same. Equipping children with the basics of these broad skill sets will help them not only navigate their way through unprecedented times but will help them flourish and hopefully make the world a better place.

        "content": "If you’ve had to feed a child during a video meeting with colleagues, you’re not alone. This is the new normal.For many women, working from home has always seemed like the ultimate goal. Getting an extra hour of sleep by skipping the morning commute or having a few quiet moments to yourself when the kids have been dropped off at school and the workday has yet to begin – that’s the stuff of dreams.Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit and working from home has been far from the relaxing lifestyle anybody imagined. Anyone with a job where working from home is a possibility is privileged in our current situation; there’s no denying that. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t incredibly tough. Tougher than anything they might ever have had to do, particularly for women.The title of this article is a misnomer, because let’s face it. As women, we don’t just have second jobs at home. We have third, fourth, fifth – fifteenth jobs! On any given day, women fulfill a number of roles. Daughter, mother, friend, nanny, cook, colleague, cleaner, teacher, driver, pet-sitter, leader. However, under lockdown, women have had to wear all of these hats, all at once, all the time. Instead of having a work-life balance, there’s now a work-life continuum, where it’s difficult to see where one part of your world ends and the other begins. The support systems we normally rely on, like childcare, transport, domestic work, and schooling, weren’t available for months. Now that they are, many women are understandably hesitant to place themselves and their family’s health at risk. So they are still under pressure to perform at their peak in these roles.The second shiftIn 2019, the World Bank reported that 45.38% of South Africa’s labour force was female. Despite their increase in economic participation over the last few decades, women are still largely expected to take on the bulk of the household work. SociologistArlie Hochschild calls this the ‘second shift’ because when you’ve finished your day job, you’re coming home to cook, clean, help with homework, fetch kids from netball practice, and more.Working from home seems to have made the second shift even more taxing on women. Research from Germany suggests that women working from home spend on average three hours more per day on childcare compared to when working from an office. The personal experiences of many moms in South Africa can confirm this, with having to find time in between your usual workload and meeting schedule to look after littles and homeschool older kids.Here is some more advice for women, by womenMaking it workThings aren’t likely to return to 100% normal any time soon, so it’s important that women working from home find ways to cope with this relentless work-and-home schedule. Here are a few tips to help you keep your sanity during this stressful time:Be honest with your manager and colleagues. You might have someone at home whom you’re caring for, such as your child or an elderly parent. Or maybe you live by yourself and the responsibility of keeping a tidy home is yours alone. No matter what your situation is at home, chores and responsibilities are going to have an impact on your workday. Rather than hiding these things, be upfront about them with your employer so they have realistic expectations of what you can and can’t get done during working hours. Structure your time. It isn’t always possible to stick to a schedule when children are involved, especially very young ones, but try to set times during the day when you will dedicate all of your focus to one task. For example, between 8 am and 9 am, you answer emails. At 10 am, you put on a load of washing. Between 12 pm and 2 pm you homeschool.This might also mean having to set boundaries with co-workers when you can and can’t attend virtual meetings. You will need to be flexible of course, but try your best to stick to your schedule.Create a family plan. It’s important to include every member of the household in a family plan of what each workday will look like, and communicate clearly what each person should be doing and when. Setting boundaries for your children about when they can disturb you is important, just as you should honour the times you have allocated to them, rather than working through these periods.Read more about dealing with your kid’s corona anxietyIf you have a partner who works from home, it’s vital they contribute to maintaining the house and looking after the children. Why not try each taking on specific chores that need to get done daily and weekly. That way, the home maintenance, and childcaring are shared fairly and you both know what you need to do at all times.Make your own space. It’s important to have a workspace that is just yours. Working at the dining table where your spouse also works and your kids are doing their homeschooling is not going to help you be productive. Even if you just set up a small desk in the corner of a shared room, having your own space will help you and your family members to keep work and home separate and respect your boundaries.Check-in with your family. As trying as these times are, they also offer a unique opportunity to spend precious time together that you might never have again. Schedule short breaks for everyone to connect. It could be a 10-minute tea break or sitting down together for lunch. Take advantage of this time and recharge your batteries by spending quality time with your loved ones. We are living in unprecedented times and it’s important to adjust your expectations of yourself. Things aren’t normal, so don’t expect to function and perform as normal. Be kind and forgive yourself when you don’t get through all the tasks you set out for the day. You are doing your best and that’s good enough. Sources: Trading Economics; Forbes  "

        "content": "All the bad news about COVID-19 got you feeling… well, down? You’re not the only one. Having a constant barrage of information coming at us from all angles is somewhat overwhelming. Not only are we having to home-school the kids, allow extra time to do the socially distanced grocery shopping and work from home where possible, but we’re supposed to do all that AND be a positive ray of sunshine?!It’s a tough pill to swallow for many.The good news is that you’re not alone. It’s so common in fact, that you may even begin to hear people start using the phrases ‘COVID fatigue’ or ‘COVID burnout’. That news isn’t supposed to make you whoop for joy at someone else’s despair, but it is supposed to let you know that there are many others experiencing the same situation.  And, with experience, come coping strategies.So, what exactly IS a burnout?A ‘normal’ burnout is generally associated with long days at the office. It’s described as a state of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion that’s caused by excessive and unresolved stress. People experiencing a burnout would typically feel a loss of meaning to their work, start to hate their job and simply feel exhausted majority of the time.You can also learn more about Curbing women abuse during COVID-19 lockdown.What is COVID fatigue then?If what you would normally think of as a typical burnout is related to work stress, a COVID burnout (or COVID fatigue) is related to the stress of hearing, reading and seeing the influx of information that we are being exposed to on a daily basis.For many of us, it’s constant information that we get from every angle. It’s everything from seeing and reading about it in the news and the stories that we hear from friends and family to the updates from your kid’s school. It’s what we’re experiencing all around us; people going about their daily lives having to wear a mask or perhaps your children not being able to visit their grandparents.And it’s not just the information you’re receiving, but also the hundreds of small decisions that you now need to make on a daily basis in addition to your normal daily routines. Should you go to the shops further away that have shorter queues or do you commit to waiting for an hour to get in at your local grocery store? Do you send the kids back to school or continue home-schooling them?The overpowering feeling of not being able to take control of the situation, the added pressures of living in a pandemic and it is the only thing you hear about these days, is what can lead to a COVID burnout. And it’s more common than you think.How do you recognize the signs of burnout?As with anything in life, everyone experiences things differently. You may not even realise that you’re experiencing burnout, because it’s not the type that you’ve heard of before. There’s a whole host of symptoms and signs that could point to being on the verge of a burnout, some of which are very similar to those of a work-stress related burnout.Examples of what you may be feeling include:·         Reduced performance and productivity·         Anxiety·         Lack of social interaction·         Irritability·         Detachment·         Feeling listless·         Low mood·         Difficulty concentrating·         Lack of creativity·         FatigueHow do you manage COVID-19 news fatigue?It’s important to understand that everyone is susceptible to burnout - we can all be affected by one. So, instead of letting things get out of hand, why not take the time to make sure that you’re doing all that you can to prevent it from happening in the first place.Probably one of the most important things you can do is to maintain your work-life balance. This can be tough at the best of times, but when your work is now being done from your living area, it can be even more difficult to ‘switch off’. Make sure that you’re sticking to your normal work routine as much as possible to prevent your work from taking over your personal life.Read more about Self-Acceptance During COVID-19 and Beyond.If you’re finding yourself overwhelmed, try to cut down your consumption of news and social media. Of course, we all want to keep in the loop and make sure we’re aware of what’s happening around us. But constantly watching the news and checking your various social media platforms and the somewhat constant bad news that is shared is bound to bring mood levels down. Why not limit yourself to checking the news or your social media twice a day – you’re staying up to date but aren’t going overboard. While you’re at it, keep a lookout for the good news. There are plenty of movements that you could follow to bring a spark of joy to your day. Try out Good Things Guy for something local, or @goodnews movement on Instagram to get a daily dose of feel-good news. While it may seem like all COVID-19 related news is bad news, there are a few good news stories sprinkled in between. You just need to look out for them!Maintaining social contact is another important aspect of preventing burnout. Try to remember that we need to be physically distancing ourselves from others, but you can still maintain social contact. Keep up those video calls and quiz nights with friends and family.  Keep in mind that a burnout generally leads to a lack of self-care. But self-care is different for everyone and you need to figure out what it is that works for you. Is it meditation and mindfulness, or is it doing a HIIT workout? Is it taking a warm bath, gardening or just simply chilling out on the couch? Don’t feel guilty if baking banana bread isn’t your thing (and don’t feel bad if it is).Take some time to check in on yourself.Acknowledge your feelings and try to figure out why it is that you’re feeling that way. If you’re able to recognise the ‘why’, you’ll be more easily able to figure out what changes to make. Most of all, try not to compare your situation to others – we all have different coping mechanisms, you just need to take the time to figure out what yours is! "

        "description": "",
        "content": "Around the world, countries are seeing job losses like never before due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the UK, around 24% of the workforce are at risk of losing their jobs, according to a recent report by McKinsey. In the USA, in April 2020, 20.5 million people lost their jobs. In our own country, it isn’t entirely clear how many jobs are at stake, but estimates have placed the figure at 1.6 million to be lost in 2020, according to a new report published by Nedbank. The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique experience in our lifetimes. The last time a virus had such a widespread impact on the world was in 1918 when the Spanish Flu infected about one-third of the world’s population. Not only are people dealing with the traumatic experience of job loss, but they’re doing it during what is likely to be the most uncertain time of their lives. If you’re feeling anxious and uncertain about your job during these trying times, or know someone who is, understanding the psychology and feelings behind losing a job can help to make the experience easier to navigate. Let’s take a look. What it’s like to lose a jobLosing a job can feel similar to the grief of losing a loved one. Psychologists recognise that people laid-off often experience the same five emotional stages of grief –  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In addition to financial worries, losing a job can have a major impact on your self-esteem and relationships. Even when it’s not your fault, such as in a case like this, you may still find yourself questioning your self-worth. This affects your mood which in turn affects your relationships. It all compounds to make a bad situation worse. Job loss during the COVID-19 pandemicWhen it comes to the psychology of losing your job during this crisis, the worries seem compounded, because not only are you stressing about your and your family’s future but that of the country as a whole. Will the economy recover? Will your friends and neighbours have jobs when this is all over? According to Sarah Damaske, an associate professor of sociology, labour, and employment relations at Pennsylvania State University, many people react with anger at their employers when they lose their jobs under normal circumstances. She believes this kind of reaction is unlikely to change even in such exceptional conditions, so know that if you’re feeling incensed at your employer, it’s perfectly normal. You might also find yourself feeling guilty – especially as a woman – that you’re stressing about yourself and your own circumstances, while millions of people around the globe are in the same or a worse-off position. Again, these feelings are normal, but try to cut yourself some slack. You’re living in a scary time where the future is completely unknown; it’s OK to worry about yourself.You can also read more about Building resilience during a time of crisis Coping with job loss in a crisisDealing with job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic is especially difficult, given that all aspects of daily life are out of sorts. Here are a few things you can do to cope during this difficult time: Stick to a routineYour daily routine probably looks nothing like it did at the beginning of the year. But no matter how things have changed, it’s important to create a new routine and stick to it. With all the uncertainty, having structure can help you feel more in control, reducing feelings of anxiety.  Connect with loved onesYou might not be able to see your friends and family in person, but making time for phone calls, texts, and video chats can be nearly as good as the real thing. A sympathetic ear or a laugh with a friend can make the world seem a little brighter. Daily affirmationsEvery day think of one thing you’re really good at and focus on it for the rest of the day. When you’re vulnerable, it’s important to remind yourself about your own worth. Challenge the negative thoughts you might have about yourself and dwell on your positive qualities. Be gentle with yourself. Plan for the futureWhile not many companies are hiring right now, you can still plan and give yourself the best possible chance of finding another job. Work on your CV refine your answers to common interview questions and set goals for when you can actively job hunt, like how many jobs you will apply for each day. Being ready to find new employment will give you a sense of purpose. Get professional helpIf you feel like you’re not coping, reach out to a professional for help. You can see a mental health professional in person, talk over the phone, or consult via video chat. These services are still available and are more important than ever. Overcoming job lossAccepting the reality of the situation is the first step to overcoming job loss. If you’re struggling to come to terms with it, try to find an outlet for your feelings, like keeping a journal or talking to a loved one. It’s also important to practice self-care. Eat well, exercise when you can, and make sure you get all the sleep your body needs. You’ll soon start to feel better.You can also read more about Tools for anxiety and stress relief Losing your job can seem like the end of the world. The anxiety of not knowing how you’ll pay the bills and put food on the table is real. However, try to remember the situation won’t last forever. And according to a study published by the American Psychological Association, few people experience enduring psychological effects after losing their jobs. In fact, most end up happier and more fulfilled than before.  Globally, people have experienced mass job losses and worldwide economic turmoil, but human beings are resilient. If you find yourself doubting your ability to cope with job loss, remember that as a South African woman, you have faced so many hardships and have risen above them. This pandemic and its consequences will be just one more thing you’ll conquer.   "

        "description": "",
        "content": "There isn’t a single person or industry in our country that hasn’t been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The national lockdown implemented to contain the spread of the virus has affected every facet of our lives: children are missing school, adults are missing work, and perhaps, worst of all, we’re missing our loved ones.A recent report by Nedbank predicts that 1.6 million people in South Africa will lose their jobs in 2020 due to the pandemic, 1.4 million of which are expected to come from just a handful of industries: wholesale and retail, repair of vehicles and other personal and household items, and hospitality. In addition to job losses now, many industries are going to feel the effects of COVID-19 for many years to come.Here are five industries that have been or will be hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa.1. Agriculture While some agricultural activities were allowed to continue in phase 5 of the national lockdown, many farmers were still unable to operate due to restrictions placed on livestock auctions, being unable to access farming equipment, and not being allowed to transport food across borders. Not only does this threaten our food security; it could place the industry at a disadvantage locally and internationally in the future; without food to supply to other countries, commercial farmers may lose their international clients and small-scale farmers may not be able to supply food to their communities. While the government has made funds available to farmers who need assistance, there is still much uncertainty about how the pandemic will affect individual farmers and large-scale operations going forward. Furthermore, a large portion of our country’s agriculture is dedicated to growing crops to produce alcohol. With alcohol sales being banned (research shows that heavy drinkers are at a higher risk of contracting the Coronavirus) the wine- and beer-making industries have been severely affected. South African Breweries (SAB) recently warned it may have to dump 132 million litres of beer and wine-makers may be able to sell their products only to the international market.2. AutomotiveFigures released by the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA) show just how badly the automotive industry has been affected by the lockdown. In April 2020, only 574 vehicles were sold in South Africa and 901 were exported. Compare these figures to those of April 2019, when 36 787 were sold locally and 32 892 were exported, it’s clear that dealerships and vehicle manufacturers are among the hardest-hit industries.3. RepairsThe repairs industry for cars, motorcycles, and personal and household goods such as air conditioners, televisions, and other appliances are all going to see major job losses, according to the Nedbank report. Most of these businesses are small-scale operations and are particularly vulnerable to a loss of income. Many will only be allowed to operate from lockdown level 2, leaving them without any income for months.4. Tourism and hospitalityWith international and domestic travel severely limited, the tourism industry is at a total standstill. What makes it even worse is the long-lasting effect COVID-19 will have after the lockdown has been lifted. People are going to be more cautious for a long time after the pandemic has been contained – many will think twice before staying at hotels or flying overseas due to the risk of picking up an infection. Additionally, the economy has already taken a major knock and many people are simply not going to have the funds to spend on travel.The hospitality industry, which includes restaurants, hotels, and casinos, is facing a major collapse. Having to remain closed for over a month during lockdown level 5 and then only being able to sell takeaway food thereafter indefinitely, many restaurants have closed their kitchens for good. Due to the close interpersonal nature of the industry, it’s likely these businesses will continue to suffer even after the curve has flattened. 5. Wholesale and retailConsumer behaviour is never going to be the same and no industry is going to see more changes than retail. With social distancing remaining an effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, shoppers are expected to conduct more of their purchasing online, with e-commerce sales already having risen during the lockdown. This means fewer employees in brick-and-mortar stores.With the economy being so strained, people will be spending even less on luxury items like TVs, fashion, and furniture in order to put food on the table and pay the water and lights every month. And of course, if the retailers aren’t selling it, they aren’t buying it from wholesalers, who will experience a knock-on effect from the reduced consumer spending. Nedbank’s report aligns with statements issued by some of the country’s biggest companies that are facing massive job cuts or even closures. Comair (an airline company) and the Edcon Group (which owns Edgars and Jet) are both entering business rescue. Flight Centre will be closing 40% of its network and SAB has advised that up to 50% of its frontline workers could lose their jobs.  It might all seem like doom and gloom, but as South Africans, we will continue to find a way to have a positive outlook and rebuild our society and economy. The COVID-19 pandemic is going to remain a part of our lives for the foreseeable future. As each and every person is affected by the virus, it’s more important than ever to lift one another up. One way to do this is to help small businesses, which are incredibly vulnerable at the moment. Doing this is as simple as ordering from your local pizza place or supporting the single mom selling homemade face masks.At 1st for Women., we are doing our bit to help too. In addition to pausing all policy reviews until July 2020 to ease the financial stresses faced by entrepreneurs, we also created a relief fund of R70 million to help small businesses during this unprecedented time.

        "content": "For the past few months, families around the country have been forced to adapt to a new normal ­— one in which ordinary freedoms are no longer an option and family dynamics have had to shift as homes become a space for work as well as parenting. We spoke to three South African moms about the unexpected benefits of a life in lockdown. Here’s what they had to say…There’s more time for the simple things  “We have been forced to slow down,” says Simone Jeffery, a Joburg-based mom whose son is ten months old. “When our baby was first born, we were so busy taking him from person to person, so we were in the car a lot and we rushed feeds sometimes. Now we have to stay home so we’ve been able to establish a routine and our baby gets more time to chill and play.”   Jackie Smit, a mom from Durban, agrees: “Social distancing has made us realise what our family really needs. Without the noise of socialising and being busy over weekends, we were able to re-evaluate what is really important to us, and how little (externally) we actually need. This has also pressed home how important it is to be mindful of boundaries. We’ve been able to find joy and gratitude right under our noses for things that had been there all along, but we just hadn’t noticed.”It\"s possible to really connect  For Jackie, being at home with her son and husband have been an unexpected benefit of an otherwise challenging situation. “The first two weeks were really hard but once we got into a rhythm it felt like we were able to work out what is actually best for our little family. Up until lockdown we were doing what we hoped was best, but because my husband and I were working we’d never really had an opportunity to let it happen organically. We’ve realised what is worth holding onto (like routine), and what could be let go of (like allowing our son some screen time if my husband and I both need a moment to focus on work).” In fact, Jackie believes that her child has thrived over the past 10 weeks: “His language has exploded and he’s learned to communicate quite complex things like his needs and his feeling states. Maybe that was always going to happen developmentally, but I can’t help but think that our being around all the time has helped that along,” she explains.Co-parenting has become a reality  For a lot of people, a life in lockdown means that both parents are able to be more present in their children’s lives. For Jenny Thomas, a mom from Port Alfred, having her partner home has been the biggest plus. “Due to his work cycle before lockdown, it often felt like I was a single mom and having him back to share day-to-day responsibilities has been a huge help. He gets up in the night when before it was only me, helps with cooking and cleaning and keeps our daughter entertained when I need to get on with other chores. I even get the occasional sleep-in!” And it’s not just Jenny who is benefiting — “From my partner’s perspective he is seeing our baby grow every day and has developed a much deeper and stronger bond with her. I often felt guilty that I was the only parent to share the ‘firsts’ and to be able to see my partner experience these things too makes them even more special. It has also given him more time to teach her new things and definitely makes him feel more involved as a parent.”"

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to award-winning journalist, Iza Grek, about the importance of self-acceptance during the time of COVID-19 and beyond. She shares her experience and insights below. COVID-19 is our new reality presenting both challenges and opportunities. It comes with an unprecedented impact, leaving chaos in its wake.As women we are often centre stage in our roles as mother, wife, daughter, sister, companion. Whether single or married or in a family with children, the constraints of lockdown have had a severe impact on living conditions and the psychology that goes with it.Our ‘normal’ has been upended and we have been forced to confront a new reality, like it or not. The level of severity of your ‘stay-home’ status may have varied from a drop in workload to an increase in workload or no work at all, being the hardest with the greatest potential for mental health challenges. Going off your rocker after more than 60 days, would be a normal reaction in these most abnormal of situations.As lockdown eases, we face the next challenge of re-socialising  and needing to confront and communicate eyeball to eyeball with other humans. After months of lockdown, are we prepared?Grooming is most likely the biggest casualty in this for many of us. It is for me, and although I shower and get dressed every day, my hair looks like rat’s tails, and that’s not just on my head. A leg wax is way overdue and my make-up  tray is collecting dust. A lick of mascara is all I can manage if I absolutely must go out to the shops, but even then, it’s an effort to even bother.  Fortunately, I  have a small frame and have made exercising a must during this process, yet I fear confronting the kilos that have climbed upon my hips never to budge, and a bigger number on the scale when I do get back to gym.Usually, super multi-taskers, with less to do we may be taken off course by multiple webinars, Netflix and other electronic distractions which can occupy hours of our time. And it’s okay if that’s where you’re at right now. No one is demanding more. Check-in if there are feelings of guilt, ‘ordering’ you to achieve as much as you do normally. We are all programmed with a sense of drive and deliverability and when it’s not there, our sense of worth dissipates.It’s important to accept ourselves as we are and to look inside for self-worth and be reminded that our worth is not demonstrated by how much we do, or how well we clean-up. Our worth is our intrinsic value as women and what we offer in our relationships both personally and professionally.“When we\"re self-accepting, we\"re able to embrace all facets of ourselves—not just the positive, more \"esteem-able\" parts,” says Dr Leon F Seltzer in his article The Path of Unconditional Self-Acceptance in Psychology Today. “As such, self-acceptance is unconditional, free of any qualification. We can recognise our weaknesses or limitations, but this awareness in no way interferes with our ability to fully accept ourselves.”Lockdown, isolation – this forced withdrawal from life as we know it, is tough on all of us, with no end in sight. We have nothing to prove and should not look to be acknowledged from anyone other than ourselves. Be kind, and give yourself all the pampering you crave and deserve when it becomes available. You’ve come this far, and that deserves a nod of approval from yourself to yourself."

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to award-winning journalist, Eugene Yiga, about making the most out of our time at home in lockdown. If you’re feeling bored from all the time at home during the COVID-19 lockdown, here’s something to consider: putting your house in order positively affects all other aspects of your life. This is the belief Marie Kondo expresses in her book The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up and her Netflix show.“I started reading home and lifestyle magazines when I was five,” she says, “and it was this that inspired me, from the age of fifteen, to undertake a serious study or tidying that led to the development of the KonMari Method.”She believes that the reason most people can’t keep their house in order is because we never learned how. And even though food, clothing, and shelter are the most basic human needs, we don’t often consider where we live as important as what we eat or what we wear. As a result, what she calls “the job that keeps the home alive” is disregarded because we assume that the ability to tidy is something we naturally acquire instead of deliberately train.How to eliminate clutterHer main inspiration was a book called The Art of Discarding by Nagisa Tatsumi. It was here that she learned that tidying a little a day means tidying forever. It’s best to tidy in one shot so that the tangible results you experience immediately cause a dramatic change in your mindset.“Rebound occurs because people mistakenly believe they have tidied thoroughly, when in fact they have only sorted and stored things halfway,” she says. “If you use the right method and concentrate your efforts on eliminating clutter thoroughly and completely within a short span of time, you’ll see instant results that will empower you to keep your space in order ever after.”Her view is that if you put your house in order properly, you’ll be able to keep it tidy even if you’re lazy or sloppy by nature. The trick is to treat it as a once-off special event, rather than a daily chore. It’s also important to realise that effective tidying involves only two essential actions: discarding and deciding where to store things. Of the two, discarding must come first.“Putting things away creates the illusion that the clutter problem has been solved,” she says. “But sooner or later, all the storage units are full, the room once again overflows with things, and so new and ‘easy’ storage method becomes necessary, creating a negative spiral. This is why tidying must start with discarding. We need to exercise self-control and resist storing our belongings until we have finished identifying what we really want and need to keep.”The problem with storageIn practical terms, she suggests that you start early in the morning, visualise your destination so that you have a vivid picture of what it would be like to live in a clutter-free space, and start in the best order: clothes, books, papers, miscellany, and mementos.“The process of deciding what to keep and what to discard will go much more smoothly if you begin with items that are easier to make decisions about,” she says. “As you gradually work toward the harder categories, you will be honing your decision-making skills.”She also suggests that you sort through things by category (not by location) because “when we disperse storage of a particular item throughout the house and tidy one place at a time, we can never grasp the overall volume and therefore can never finish”.“Things stored out of sight are dormant,” she says. “This makes it much harder to decide whether they inspire joy or not. By exposing them to the light of day and jolting them alive, so to speak, you’ll find it’s surprisingly easy to judge whether they touch your heart.”Sparks of joyHer key criterion for deciding whether or not to keep something is by physically taking it in your hands and asking if it sparks joy. This means the process is more about deciding what you want to keep and less about what you want to get rid of.“When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life,” she says. “You’ll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order. In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure.”For things you struggle to let go of, her suggestion is that you don’t let your family see what you plan to throw away (“what you don’t need, your family doesn’t either”) in case they change your mind. Similarly, as much as it might seem economical, don’t force items you don’t want onto others (“your parents’ home is not a haven for [your] mementos”) because you can’t bring yourself to discard or donate them. The only exception is if these items would spark joy for the people you have in mind.“Just because you dispose of something does not mean you give up past experiences or your identity,” she says. “Through the process of selecting only those things that inspire joy, you can identify precisely what you love and what you need. “Putting your house in orderUltimately, her belief is that tidying is just a tool and not the final destination. What matters most is that you’re working toward a lifestyle you want. Indeed, because a major reorganisation of your home causes a major reorganisation of your perspective, putting your house in order means putting your affairs in order too. This allows you to see clearly what your life needs and doesn’t need as well as what you should and shouldn’t do.“When your [space] is clean and uncluttered, you have no choice but to examine your inner state,” she says. “You can see any issues you have been avoiding and are forced to deal with them. From the moment you start tidying, you will be compelled to reset your life. As a result, your life will start to change.”"

        "content": "In recognition of Mental Health Awareness Week, 1st for Women Insurance spoke to Helen Hajiyiannis, Director of Centre for AIDS Development, Research and Evaluation (CADRE). Helen offers this practical advice on navigating the emotional tsunami of COVID-19:Establish a new routine at home, as routines have been disrupted by Covid-19. Plan regular activities that help you feel good.Counter isolation from friends and family by setting up virtual lunch and coffee dates via the various technology available.Spend time on self-care - this is not selfish but necessary. Make time to look after yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually, and ensure adequate rest, nutrition and exercise.A key component of self-care is debriefing. Informal check-in sessions amongst colleagues or family members is also useful to build support and social cohesion.If you feel overwhelmed, there are ways to get support. Talk to your colleagues, your friends, family, or someone that you trust about how you are feeling. Remember you are not alone in this situation – your peers are likely to be experiencing similar things to you – and you can support each other.Be compassionate to yourself and to others. It is okay to say that you are not okay.We are all impacted in some way by the ripple effects of COVID-19 – from isolation and social distancing to job losses and financial struggles. This can drastically impact our mental health. With this in mind, we encourage you to use this advice to help alleviate the burden, and take the necessary steps to prioritise your mental health."

        "content": "There’s an African proverb that says it takes a village to raise a child.  That an entire community of people should work together to nurture and protect children.  In a Covid-19 context, this adage is apt, but not just for children.Social distancing and lockdown restrictions have shattered traditional support structures andwomen from across South Africa are turning to virtual networks for advice, assistance and inspiration. 1st for Women recognised this, and is currently supporting a number of women-focused community groups that do so much for so many.  We believe these social media groups are performing an essential service in helping women navigate the complexities of home schooling, relationships and financial woes, and deserve to be recognised, and supported, for playing their part.We recently asked members of The Village, a 35 000 member strong Facebook community run by the incredible Vanessa Raphaely, for advice on getting through the lockdown period and beyond.The advice received was so motivating and uplifting that we decided to share the top 10 here – because empowered women empower women:Lauren Milne Meiring:  Every part of this life is a phase. Sometimes it may feel as though you fly through a phase. Other times it feels like trying to swim through molasses to get to the other side. Nevertheless, everything remains a phase. As mothers we watch our kids make it through different phases. Great ones, sleepless ones, terrible twos, terrible teens and all the wonderful ones in between. Our own lives are exactly the same. The most important thing to remember during the difficult phases is to keep moving, even if it is just to do the next thing that needs to get done. Each small step is life and is valid and valuable. Keep moving and celebrate your phases!Judy MacGregor:  There\"s so much advice and activities shared right now but sometimes you have to quieten your soul, step back and do what is right for you and your family, even if that looks completely different to the way someone else is walking this journey.Amanda Leigh Pieterse:  Be slow to judge, we never know what others are dealing with. Especially in times like these. We are often so quick to judge without trying to understand first. Love. Respect.Stacey Lewis: Commit to finding the sparkle in everything....even on a bad day, there is always something to smile about and be grateful. We choose the filter through which we view the world....choose to find the light the laughter and the brightness....sometimes we have to search a little more, but it\"s always there...there are gifts that are sometimes wrapped up in sandpaper, but the gifts are nevertheless there. A mindset of gratitude creates happiness, abundance and blessings. It\"s all a choice.Deirdre Taylor:  We have the choice to either be like ostriches and dig our head in the sand and only deal when faced, or we can plan ahead with the absolute intention that we\"re only doing this to be in a better space and not act from a space of overwhelm or fear.Adele Lourens: Normal is not normal anymore. The best way to get through it is to not expect anything, just go with life. This situation is just life happening. Hectic, but it is still happening.Jocelynne Lake: Accept all parts of yourself, light and dark, good and bad, as by doing so you will not only be kinder to yourself but to everyone else too.Alana Patton: Take it one day at a time. If one day is too long, take one hour at a time. You can survive through anything if you know it’s only going to be an hour. Then reset and repeat. Also, be patient and gracious with yourself.Kayla-Tess Pattenden: It takes a village to get through a crisis. When we focus on others we are empowered to help and don’t sit in self-pity or concern. This has been a call to be the village of South Africa, caring for others and in so doing knowing others will care for you in return. I now understand the spirit of Ubuntu.Neesa Moodley: Use a digital calendar that everyone in the house puts their activities for the day on - from home school timetables to household chores to business meetings and even lunch. This ensures that there are no clashes with anyone hogging the wifi and easy to keep track of what everyone is doing when. Neesa recommends this resourceFor more practical tips and advice, join The Village on Facebook."

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to Nikki Temkin, journalist of 20 years and accredited functional health and wellness coach. In this article, Nikki explores how we can use the lockdown to our advantage, finding meaning and joy in the things we usually take for granted.Lockdown has been challenging on so many levels. We’re simply used to having our freedom – the freedom to eat out, go to the gym, work from an office, visit the mall, and all the other things that have been curtailed. Human beings are social creatures and we’re used to gathering, congregating, visiting, entertaining, meeting and socialising. The introverts among us might perhaps find this time a little easier yet we all have a need to connect with others in our own way. Plus, we’ve had to adjust to a new and strange way of life with all the uncertainty and stress that the Coronavirus has causedIn wellness coaching we look for ways to reframe things, to change the narrative and to look for opportunities for growth. Yet, we all have different situations, capacities and energy levels so these are simply suggestions that might help make this time a little easier—there’s no need to feel pressured to perform or achieve or be super productive. Some of us might find that we have more time and some of us might actually have less time and this can also change daily. What can you do to make lockdown work for you?Learn something. Is there a course or a project that you’ve been longing to do for a while but haven’t had the time or headspace? If you’re needing more stimulation, or feel a bit bored, now might be the time to dig into that photography, drawing, meditation, cooking, or writing course or make those photo books. If there are things you can learn that might help you to upskill in your chosen career then research what’s out there that could add value to your offering - perhaps it’s social media, digital marketing or branding, etc. There are many specials on offer right now and some of these courses might even be for free. This means that you’ll emerge from this period feeling more fortified and ready to face whatever comes next.Clean it up. Being at home so much, you might have noticed how you’re hoarding things you don’t need or that you haven’t cleaned out that your cupboard for years. There are many out there who are less fortunate who may appreciate what you no longer need or use. Getting rid of clutter also helps us to feel more in control and even more mentally focused. Just pick a drawer, cupboard or shelf and begin.Connect to others. Being a hermit might work for a while but there’s a reason that we form friendships outside of our immediate family. Send a message to someone that you haven’t been in touch with for a while, check in with that great aunt who lives alone, engage on your neighborhood WhatsApp and chat on your moms’ group. And Facetime with friends and family.Move it. Get online and move your body to the myriad of offerings out there. Whatever you choose to do from yoga and Pilates to aerobics and tai chi or simply walking on the spot or jumping on the trampoline, keeping moving and staying strong will get the blood flowing and keep you mentally healthy.Give to others. When things are tough, helping people in need can be very uplifting. Find out which ways you can assist – whether it’s providing food or donating money to a charity. Or maybe it’s just being there for someone who is struggling There are very few things that increase our feeling of wellbeing as much as kindness.Enjoy the simple things. Go back to basics with board games, talking to your kids without distractions, listening to and playing music, and strolling in the garden if you have one. Notice the small things, the taste of a fruit, the sound of birds and the feeling of a bubble bath. All the little things we take for granted can bring us much joy if we just bring awareness to them."

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to Nikki Temkin, journalist of 20 years and accredited functional health and wellness coach. In this article Nikki focuses on the power of building resilience in times of crisis, a particularly crucial topic at present.  The word resilience stems from the Latin root for “rebound or recoil.\" As a character trait, resilience is a person\"s mental ability to recover quickly from misfortune or adversity. Psychological resilience is the ability mentally or emotionally cope with a crisis or to return to pre-crisis status quickly. It means being able to adapt to the curveballs that life constantly throws. How can we engender reliance in ourselves during this major crisis?Find the silver lining. It might be a cliché to be asked to look for the good in every situation. Yet, even at a time when so many in the world are struggling, uncertain, perhaps even sick and worried about the future, finances, and the economy, their jobs and so much more, it builds resilience, to find something uplifting in the situation. Perhaps it’s being able to spend more time with your family, living at a slower pace, or maybe it’s even finding the strength to set better boundaries with your kids.Stay neutral and adaptable. Resilient people tend to have more of a growth mindset as opposed to a fixed mindset. This means that they look for the opportunities in whatever situation they find themselves in. Being neutral means not judging something as “good” or “bad”. It simply is the way it is. This perspective means that becoming adaptable and flexible is easier. It takes a conscious effort. Accepting our situation and letting go of the outcome, allows us to adapt and perhaps even be able to thrive in the face of adversity. Acknowledging that it’s okay to feel vulnerable, low, scared or angry sometimes is understandable, authentic and powerful. But, not allowing yourself to get sucked into those feelings is resilience.Practice patience. Part of being resilient is having the understanding that sometimes we need to be able to wait for things to get better or to reap the rewards for seeds we may have sown in our life to take root and bear fruit.Surrender. Surrendering is not the same as giving up. It simply means accepting that some things are out of our control and beyond our realm of understanding. We do not know when Covid-19 will allow us to go back to the life we had before this global health emergency. We also don’t know how life might look beyond this. But, we do know that our behaviour and attitude are still within our control even when our freedom may be limited. We have the choice how to respond – with negativity and fear or with hope and kindness to ourselves and others. Resisting the pull towards negativity is resilience.Stay in the present moment. Staying truly in the moment gives you the chance to remove yourself fromadversity and conserve your inner energy. This doesn’t mean that you don’t care or aren’t affected by the past or future. It means that when you decide to do something, you focus all your attention on solely doing it, rather than letting your mind wander into the future or the past. You can do this with anything whether it be baking, reading, exercising, playing a game or picking a flower. It’s like giving your brain a holiday from worry.Be with likeminded people. It’s important to set strict boundaries with or avoid people who are toxic. By this I mean those people who deplete your mental and physical energy. They might do this by constantly complaining, are narcissistic and self-interested, or by always seeing the negative.Have self-belief. Resilient people believe that they can get things done, that they can overcome, that somehow they will make it through to the other side of a crisis. If your self-belief is wavering, work on it!Focus on solutions. Make plans for the future, keep your dreams intact and look forward to the possibilities. Resilient people may adapt their desires to the current reality, and reflect upon and acknowledge the past, but they never stop looking to the future. The ability to visualise our ambitions and understanding what we want creates a foundation for our success.  Reaching success requires taking the next step, every day, no matter how hard it may be, even during a crisis."

Nikki shares valuable insights and practical advice on mental and physical wellbeing during lockdown and beyond. In this article, Nikki offers tips for moms to help kids cope with anxiety in these uncertain times.Stories about Coronavirus/Covid-19 and the threat that it presents us with as human beings are everywhere: in the media, on the radio, all over TV and the Internet. There’s really no escape from it and for sure, your kids have overheard you talking about it to others and noticed the masks and gloves that people are wearing. It’s also the first time that school has suddenly stopped for a reason other than a holiday.The truth is that children will worry more when kept in the dark about it. Managing their anxiety when dealing with your own is a difficult task. Here are some tips: Manage your own anxiety. Your kids will pick up on whatever you are feeling. The more relaxed and calm you can be, the better for them. Yet, it’s also OK to be honest and explain that even you have your own worries which is normal at this time. If you are feeling overwhelmed, panicked or anxious rather wait until you feel better to chat with them. If you need help or support to manage your stress during this time, draw on your tools and resources or seek out support in the form of a friend, a counsellor, wellness coach or another healthcare professional.Discuss Corona with your kids. Avoiding talking about what’s obviously going on will simply exacerbate your children’s anxiety. Plus, they need to understand why they need to wash their hands or can’t see their friends or granny right now. It’s your job to filter the facts for your children – drawings or online cartoons can also be helpful. Find out what they know so that you can correct any misinformation. The goal is to give them facts-based information that’s reassuring and comforting. If masks are frightening to them, you can explain that those people are being extra cautious.Talk to them in a developmentally appropriate way. Giving more information than they need or too much detail will just be confusing. Do your best to be honest and direct. Answer their questions if you can and it’s also okay if you don’t have all the answers. Allow them to express their fears no matter how fantastical or dramatic they might be. Invite them to talk about their feelings no matter how uncomfortable and help them label the emotions. Being emotionally present for them is the best way to comfort and soothe children and to focus on everything you are all doing to stay safe and what can be controlled (e.g.s handwashing and social isolation) to make them feel empowered. It may be helpful to share with them that most people will recover from the virus and that kids seem to have much milder symptomsFill the gaps where possible. Coronavirus may have left your children feeling a sense of loss or grief. Perhaps they are missing birthday parties, family get-togethers, their extra murals and socialising. Technology can help them connect with friends, family and even teachers. Try and encourage them to have daily contact with the people that they miss. Incorporate fun activities into each day whether it’s a boardgame or a creative craft activity. Some kids may not even mind doing schoolwork as it provides them with a sense of familiarity.Have a routine. Structure helps to make kids feel safe. Creating a daily routine and putting it where the kids can see it will help. Give them coping skills on the daily routine and these will not just serve them now but for the rest of their lives.Move it. Kids need physical movement and exercise on a daily basis to relieve stress and pent-up energy. Find an online workout that they can join in whatever exercise they enjoy or go out into the garden and throw a ball or do a silly dance. This will help to manage their stress.Cut them some slack. It’s entirely understandable that kids might act out during this time by behaving badly, overreacting, fighting with siblings, having tantrums and other reactions. Teenagers might become more insolent and monosyllabic. Remember that even adults are having a hard time facing the unpredictably and uncertainty of this challenge – they are just kids so give them a break!"

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to Nikki Temkin, journalist of 20 years and accredited functional health and wellness coach. Nikki shares valuable insights and practical advice on mental and physical wellbeing during lockdown and beyond. In this article she focuses on the value of sleep in supporting our immune systems.  It’s never been more crucial than now to keep your immune system functioning optimally. Sleep deprivation is just no longer a viable option for optimal health. Burning the candle at both ends is no longer considered a badge of honor, even in our modern “always on” culture.Much research has been done on how sleep affects just about everything including mental health, memory, concentration, mood, weight, appetite and blood sugar, judgment, and crucially, the immune system. Our immune system is designed to protect us from colds, flu, and other ailments, but it can’t when it’s not  functioning properly.Many studies show that people who don\"t get quality sleep (or even enough sleep) are more likely to get sick after being exposed to a virus. Lack of sleep can also affect how fast you recover if you do get sick. Quality sleep is essential to keeping your body optimal to ward off any potential illness. The hours of sleep before midnight are more valuable to the body than those acquired between midnight and rising.In the deepest and most restorative third stage of sleep (known as N3 and N4), blood pressure drops; breathing becomes slower; muscles are relaxed; blood supply to muscles increases; tissue growth and repair occurs, energy is restored and many hormones including Growth Hormone, essential for growth and development, is released. Brain cells shrink by 60%, increasing the space between them so toxins and waste products can be flushed effectively away. Your entire body is undergoing important repair and detoxification.Also, during sleep your immune system releases proteins called cytokines, as well as immune boosting T cells.  Essential cytokines are needed to increase when you have an infection or inflammation (as you would during a virus or infection), when you\"re under stress and even when suffering from chronic illnesses like heart disease and diabetes. Sleep deprivation can decrease production of these protective cytokines. Plus, infection-fighting antibodies and cells are reduced when you’re not getting enough sleep. The more sleep loss, the higher your levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) will be. This is a marker of inflammation in your system – the latest research shows that inflammation plays a role in pretty much every possible health condition. For deep, quality sleep to happen, it’s a good idea to adopt a routine of sleep hygiene.Sleep Hygiene means:  No alcohol at least three hours before bedtime.Not drinking caffeine-containing beverages from 2pm.Doing your daily exercise before 6pm.The optimal amount of sleep for most adults is seven to eight hours of good sleep each night. Teenagers need about nine to 10 hours of sleep. School children may need 10 or more hours of sleep.Screen-free time. Set aside your cell phone, Netflix and laptop at least an hour or even two before bedtime. The blue light of screens and the overload of information is very stimulating and won’t help your body or mind to calm down before turning in for the night.Keeping to the same wake up and go to sleep time each day. This trains your biological clock into a particular habit.Avoiding anxiety producing activities before bedtime e.g. paying the billsHaving a bedtime ritual prepares your brain and body for sleep e.g. taking a hot bath before bedtime will help to soothe and relax the system. Throw in some Epsom salts and lavender oils for an extra deep sleep.  Avoiding eating within three hours of bedtime. Your body then won’t be bothered with having to digest a meal when it needs to be resting.Dealing with any stress way before your head hits the pillow. Whether this means journaling, meditating, breathing exercises or praying, processing the day’s stresses and emotions before going to sleepCorrecting any sleep issues that could prevent quality sleep e.g. sleep apnea, reliance on sleeping pills, snoring, insomnia and other sleep disorders. You may need to consult a health professional, sleep clinic or wellness coach to assess the challenge you’re facing.If anxiety is preventing a good night’s rest then schedule an appointment with someone to help you with some tools, supplements or therapeutic interventions to manage anxiety or stress."

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to Nikki Temkin, journalist of 20 years and accredited functional health and wellness coach. Nikki shares valuable insights and practical advice on mental and physical wellbeing during lockdown and beyond – starting with the management of anxiety and stress. The Covid- 19 crisis and the ensuing lockdown is unprecedented in our lifetimes. It’s completely understandable that we might feel anxious and stressed. Not only are we worried about falling ill or our family’s health or someone we care about getting sick, but also possibly balancing trying to work from home, perhaps looking after kids, maybe doing housework as well as having financial concerns and uncertainty about life after the Corona Virus.However, there are some steps you can take for your emotional wellbeing and to manage your anxiety to help you cope at this time.Make a list of what you can and cannot control right now. Doing this can be helpful as accepting what you cannot change will give you more perspective and to focus on what you are able to do. Of all the things you can control, your response and attitude to the situation is in your hands. Also, keeping to social isolation rules and taking the necessary hygiene precautions when you have to go out is within your control.Create a routine. Having some kind of structure or routine to your day will create a feeling of comfort and safety. Our brains respond to predictable activities and will help to relax a vigilant nervous system.Limit social media. Set aside certain times of the day to engage, read articles and posts about Corona on social media platforms. Constantly putting your energy there may cause you to feel panic and hysteria. Scrolling endlessly will create more anxiety. Create screen-free time and strong boundaries with how much information to access. Avoid reading about Covid 19 before bedtime. Allow calm, screen-free time to do other activities. On the other hand, do try and seize opportunities for lightness and humour whatever shape or form that takes. Let yourself off the hook. It’s overwhelming right now to pressure yourself with all the things you think you “should” be doing right now. Reduce your goals. It’s a traumatic time and you need to process it. Let go of the need to be a super-achiever or compare yourself to others. Whatever your best is, that is good enough and remember that everybody is different.Breathe deeply. Deep breathing will take your body out of the stress response of fight or flight and stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system to relax your body. Chronic stress can be paralysing, increases anxiety and depletes the immune system. The method I suggest is slowly inhaling through the nose, expanding your belly, chest and lungs, holding the breath and then slowly exhaling through the mouth. Placing your hand over your heart while doing this and thinking of someone or a place you love will increase the feeling of calm. You need only a few breaths to feel the stress response diminish.Make connections. It’s important not to lose touch with friends, family and colleagues. Technology enables you to do this in the way that suits you best. Try Zoom, Skype or a WhatsApp video call. There’s also texting and emails! Human beings are social animals and need contact. Reach out – you are not alone.Practice gratitude. Even in a crisis we can all find things to be grateful for. Make it a daily habit to write down or to contemplate all the things in your life or about your life that you can appreciate.Be mindful. Become aware of your emotions and find ways to process them. If you’re feeling anxious, acknowledge the anxiety, allow yourself to feel it and then let it pass through you. Being conscious of how you feel and naming it, is a self-care practice. Mindfulness might also entail meditation or visualisation techniques.Make health a priority. Never has it been more important to feed your body with immune boosting nourishing food. Good nutrition will boost your mood. Keep your body active and moving. Do the best you can within your environment. There are lots of apps that are offering free classes of whatever type of exercise and level you are at. Sleep soundly.  Quality Sleep is essential for good mental health and for resilience of body and mind. Getting between 7-9 hours of good sleep a night will help manage stress levels."

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to Lori Milner, TedX speaker, coach, author, trainer and self-leadership expert. Lori shares advice and guidance for women on navigating their way through this unprecedented time. In this article, Lori shares the importance of letting go and showing ourselves kindness and empathy – especially when things don’t go according to plan. There is so much advice on how to tackle our new way of being. One of which is to ensure a well-organized schedule for your time as well as your kids. Now I am the preacher on using your calendar to schedule work and life tasks to ensure they get done. My mantra is – ‘If it gets scheduled, it gets done!’ There is a huge ‘however’ coming…HOWEVER….this philosophy has been tested to its limits in the last week. I planned the week ahead knowing exactly what outputs and deliverables I wanted to achieve and then sat down to make an ‘excellent’ schedule for my children ages 5 and 7. Day 1 did not work out too well….By the end of the day, I was so frustrated because I kept hearing myself say throughout the day ‘but I should be further along because you should be doing X or I should have finished X by now’. I was so annoyed that the day wasn’t flowing according to my plan and felt frustrated with myself and this naturally gets diffused into the energy of the house. If this sounds familiar, keep reading. I want to share with some thoughts on how to better approach this new reality and how you can manage your headspace and thinking to ensure the time ahead is productive, fun and a pleasant place for your family to be: Learn to let goIn my previous blog, I wrote how we need to let go of the things we can’t control and focus on what we can. I decided it’s pretty good advice and used a new lens to adjust my attitude accordingly. Have a schedule but with a lightness and flexibility towards it. Children are little people and like us, they want some autonomy on how they want to spend their days too.The way to let go is to practice kindness towards yourself. If you didn’t complete the intended task then just focus on what you did accomplish and pick up when you can. I’m not suggesting you adopt a slacker mentality and just do the bare minimum. I am sharing my experience that getting yourself worked up to the point that results in pure frustration at yourself and others isn’t going to serve you during this time. I am a typical A-type so trust me this has been exceptionally hard for me to get my ahead around.We are in different times, especially having kids and family at home. It is not possible for the day to flow like a typical work day. When you get disturbed or you simply just couldn’t get to it – allow yourself the space to not be perfect. Let’s celebrate imperfection because all you can be at this point is celebrate being imperfectly perfect. This notion comes from the beautiful Japanese concept of ‘Wabi Sabi’. In her book Beth Kempton shares the following insight which is so apt right now:“We need to find ways to slow down, so life does not rush right past us. We need to start noticing more beauty to lift our spirits, and keep us inspired. We need to give ourselves permission to let go of judgement and the endless pursuit of perfection. And we need to start seeing each other–and ourselves–for the perfectly imperfect treasures that we are”.I love this quote from Beth – ‘Letting go of what you think should be does not mean giving up on what could be’. In that one line, she gave me permission that what I want to achieve just practically cannot happen in this period but it doesn’t mean I won’t achieve the goal. It is about a recognition and surrender to the current situation. It is not about not achieving goals and dreams, just pressing a slight pause around the time lines. It is also about dropping expectations of what ‘should’ happen in your day. Just because it’s in the calendar with colour coding and highlighters – doesn’t mean it will necessarily unfold that way. When you fight with your expectations, you will end up in overwhelm. As I said, two months ago – I would not be writing these words. But having a flexible and agile approach is what is needed to succeed day to day.“Put simply, Wabi Sabi gives you permission to be yourself. It encourages you to do your best but not make yourself ill in pursuit of an unattainable goal of perfection. It gently motions you to relax, slow down and enjoy your life. And it shows you that beauty can be found in the most unlikely of places, making every day a doorway to delight.” Don’t be tricked into the illusion of full days with no distractionThere is a false sense of how much time is actually available to us during this period. One thinks I have the whole day to spend time on something because I have eliminated travel time. When in reality, you are only going to get a few hours to yourself if you are a parent or looking after other family members through this period. Contending with kids, parents, fill in the blanks – you will be disturbed, distracted and quite frankly, you need to be there for them. I realised I was expecting too much of myself in one day and put these ridiculous deadlines on work that could quite honestly be done over a few days or even weeks. Again, I had to let go of the schedule mentality and rather aim for the progress daily mentality – the micro win strategy. When you break your tasks down into bite size chunk, every time you accomplish something – that’s a micro win. The good news is micro wins done consistently over time result in progress and ultimately success. The trick here is be realistic what micro wins can happen in a day. Some days are going to be better than others but work with a kindness towards yourself. Enjoy the process of what you need to do and don’t get stuck on the result. If you managed to write 200 words but you aimed for 1000 – give yourself a break and celebrate what you did do. Time to rethink what a micro win could beIt’s also changing your definition of what a micro win can be. Perhaps you managed to stay patient and operate from a place of calm the whole day despite the natural frustrations that occur. That’s a huge win! Being the person to keep the house in a positive frame of mind is a success. This situation has also brought in opportunities for rethinking your priorities and perspective. A month ago, I was so focused on my upcoming workshop scheduled for the 27th March and now my focus is ensuring my family are in a good head space during this time and putting valuable writing into the world. My intention every day is about contribution. When you move your focus from ‘me’ to ‘we’ – you enable yourself to be energised by a larger cause greater than yourself. On the days you feel like you have achieved nothing, simply picking up the phone and checking in on someone else to lift their day is equally a win. Have empathyEmpathy is critical. This simply means sitting down and thinking how each person in the house must be dealing with this and what is it like to be in their shoes right now. My kids acted up hugely the first few days and I was starting to get quite impatient. I called a special friend for some guidance on the situation and she pointed out to me that they are feeling equally out of sorts. They don’t quite understand why they aren’t at school, they can’t see their friends and why we can’t go to the usual places. This special lady told me ‘Walk a mile in their Mockersons’ and just think about it from their point of view. It is so obvious and makes so much sense. So I sat down with my son and said to him ‘wow, it must be so weird being home at the moment, does it feel a little strange?’ and I gave him room to chat and give him space to explore his feelings. Just naming the feeling you are experiencing gives you the emotional bandwidth to let it go especially for kids – give them names for these strange feelings and a way to make sense of it.Give your loved ones space to express themselves and explore their emotions. Anger, frustration, sadness, overwhelm and anxiety are just some of the emotions that will naturally arise. But then be able to help them shift to a more beneficial place like gratitude. Have a daily ritual where everyone can share what the best part of the day was and at least one thing they are grateful for. Take a pause before respondingNow we are all human. And even having empathy can still leave you feeling frustrated, annoyed and out of balance. The reality is you still have work to get done and now even more challenging circumstances in which to complete it.  When you can feel yourself getting a bit heated, press the mental pause button. Stop yourself, take a breath and just pause. Brendon Burchard, author and trainer, has a wonderful approach and says ‘Ask yourself – how would my higher self-respond right now?’ It gives you the distance to move into a space of mindful responding rather than out of control reacting.We are all a little on edge right now. If you receive a rude email or WhatsApp message – pause! Do not respond immediately. You will say something you regret and you can never take it back. Give yourself a few hours or even a day to cool off. When you can respond from a place of fact rather than emotion, you can reengage the conversation. And best to do it telephonically than text or email. Now more than ever is the time for real connection.One way I use my mental pause button when I get disturbed by the kids is to insert the thought ‘Is 10 minutes really going to matter in the scheme of things?’This is really powerful because often all your kids and loved ones want is your undivided attention. Even if it’s just 10 minutes. Maybe they want to show you something they made or help with a game or whatever. Remind yourself it is only 10 minutes – maybe its 20 – but approach them with love and kindness and patience. This is so important because if every time they come to you and you respond with frustration and anger, they will start to feel it. 10 minutes of undivided attention will mean the world to them but barely register on your radar.They also need some connection, comfort and care. I’m not saying don’t set boundaries, equally they also need to respect when it’s your work time. But just for the next week or so, while they are also adjusting, practice a little more patience than normal. I set an alarm every day for 6pm reminding me to be patient, kind and nurturing. Because at that time of the day, when I am tired and they think it’s funny to play games at teeth time – I need a gentle nudge that this is how I need to show up for them. Practice contentment in the momentI know this sounds very Zen but hear me out. If you don’t consciously manage your mind, it will manage you.This is an opportunity to reconnect to loved ones as well as ourselves. I was doing some writing this morning and my son asked if I can help with his homework. I put the laptop away and we sat together chatting while he did his work. I made a conscious decision to practice contentment by reminding myself ‘I get to…’ I get to sit with him and spend quality time together. The alternative is as the above – frustration and annoyance of all the things ‘I could and should be doing’ and he would be left feeling rejected. There is nothing easy about this time – it is filled with financial concerns amongst a lot more but creating this default thought of ‘I get to’ reminds you what is important. At the end of this crisis, I want to leave the house with a peace of mind I was there for my family and showed up as my best self. It is possible to do both – serve your clients and community as well as your family. But practising contentment enables you to have the same result but without the unnecessary stress and frustration.Ultimately – there is no one way to navigate this time ahead but the most important thing is that you make sure you do it your way. Don’t compare yourself to another person or fall into the mental jail of ‘I should be doing it like this’, it ‘should be rolling out like that’. I tried this for a few days and it is a recipe for disaster, frustration and unnecessary stress. Do it your way – do it the way that brings harmony. Forget balance during this time – aim for harmony in the house. Every day is going to be different. Some days you will nail it and some days you will feel like a complete failure because you lost your temper when you promised yourself you wouldn’t. You are human. I have lost it plenty! But all I can do is ask ‘how can I do it better tomorrow’, ‘what can I do differently to avoid being triggered?’ The key in this period is to identify your triggers – what time of the day, what activity, which person usually gets you stirred up and then figure out a way to catch yourself from reacting. This time ahead has huge opportunity for reflection and personal growth. Start the day reminding yourself who you want to be and how you want to show up. It is micro choices throughout the day and being aware of your thoughts that will be your map. Here’s to being imperfectly perfect and just letting go,Warm wishesLori"

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to Lori Milner, TedX speaker, coach, author, trainer and self-leadership expert. Lori shares advice and guidance for women on navigating their way through this unprecedented time. She starts by looking at how we equate our self-worth with the roles we play. We all wear many hats – the parent hat, friend hat, work hat, child hat, etc. most of us identify strongest with our work hat because this takes up most of the day to day actions. We spend most of our time at work and therefore this shapes us greatly. If I ask you to tell me about yourself, you will probably answer ‘I’m a marketing manager, I’m an Executive, a PA, Sales Manager, etc. but what happens when this has been taken away from you or the role has shifted dramatically. Some people have completely lost their jobs during this time or their roles have been shifted to online and made them feel obsolete. For some people, like coaches or trainers, the transition is pretty smooth. But if your job was face to face or required you to be in a physical location to operate, your whole world has been rocked upside down.This is a temporary time but a reality to work through nonetheless. If this affects you or perhaps someone close to you – I want to share some tools to reframe your thinking about this. If you are feeling lost, stuck and unsure of how to move forward during the transition- here are some thoughts: Connect to other areas of yourselfIf your identity in your work role has been taken away – then where else can you look to? Perhaps your role as a spouse, sibling, parent, friend or care giver. It is very easy to fall into the trap of focusing on what is missing or lacking but when this happens force yourself to pivot your mind to where else you are a contribution and that you matter. Can you assist your kids with homework or just being a support to them? Can you check in daily with a friend who is isolated and be their support system? It is not about ignoring the situation but realising you are not your work alone and you can find great satisfaction and meaning in the other roles you play. Use a question to change focus Tony Robbins suggests that when you start to feel lost or down – immediately shift this train of thought with a better question. Instead of ‘How come this always happens to me?’ replace it with ‘What is this here to teach me or what can I learn from this?’ Or remove the focus off yourself completely and ask ‘How can I be a better parent today, how can I be a better friend today?’ When you derive value and worth from looking beyond yourself, you will naturally shift how you feel about yourself. Remind yourself that your self-worth is not tied to your achievements This is a tough one. For most of us, it is the default way to assess ourselves. In this time, whether you are still working your traditional role or not – you may just not be able to achieve the same outputs due to circumstance. The solution – accept yourself unconditionally and have compassion towards yourself. Know that this is a period in time and it will pass. Write a list of previous accomplishments or simply a gratitude list to remind you of what you do have and what you are capable of. How can I repurpose my skills?Perhaps you lost your job as a caterer or chef. You haven’t lost your skill set or the ability to do the task at hand. So ask yourself – how can I repurpose these skills? Anyone can become a thought leader thanks to YouTube; LinkedIn and blog sites like WordPress. You don’t need fancy equipment plus everyone is in the same boat and aren’t expecting a flawlessly edited video. Why not start a cooking channel on YouTube for parents and kids to do together? Write a blog about your best cooking tips? Maybe knitting is your absolute passion that you can share with people? Perhaps you are in the fitness industry – start a channel on teaching people exercise routines? Write about what you love – share your knowledge. You can charge a small amount for people to access the content or you can just share it to be a contribution and value add at this time. What would I tell my best friend to do?This tool has been my greatest weapon against my own mind. If you don’t manage your mind, it will manage you. It is very easy to let your thinking spiral out of control when you start imagining the worst case scenarios. My way to ground myself is to journal about ‘What would I tell my best friend to do’. I literally write a letter to myself giving myself the advice as if I was my best friend. The reason this works so well is because you insert a distance between yourself and the situation. You can look objectively at the situation and therefore think clearly in fact and not get sucked into the drama. Write completely in stream of consciousness – don’t ‘overthink’ what you want to say. Write without stopping for at least 2 pages. Then go back and reread the letter. You will find that you have all the answers you need inside you. Create a morning routine filled with personal developmentWake up one hour earlier and use that time for personal growth and development. This can be for meditation, reading, studying or even watching a YouTube video on something related to your craft – not cat videos! This is a crucial time to take this seriously because when you can’t control the outside circumstances like being able to do your daily work – you can still choose where to spend your time productively. Read non-fiction books or biographies to learn from other people’s journeys and how they coped with adversity. When you discover they too experienced hardships and failures but still persevered to success, it gives you the inspiration to push through. Ask yourself – who do I want to become through this time? How do I want to emerge back into the ‘real world’ when the time comes? If you feel lost in your situation, do what you can to gain clarity. What skills can I work on developing now?If technology scares you or intimidates you, now is the time to become friends with it. So definitely get comfortable with the online platforms. But also – having a tool like YouTube gives you access to any skill in the world. Maybe you want to start Chess, cooking, yoga, public speaking – whatever it is you want to improve on, it’s there. The good news is even 20 minutes a day can go a long way to learning a new skill. Schedule in your 20 minute learning slot – you can do longer if available to you. But at least you are taking your power back by boosting your skill set and igniting the love of learning again. What have you always wanted to do but have been ‘too busy’ for?If your regular work requirements have been turned outside down – ask yourself – what have I always wanted to do but I used busyness as an excuse? Maybe a craft like baking, painting, gardening, writing, that old guitar that’s been stashed away for ages? If you feel depleted by the work situation, what can you do to energise yourself and tap into a creative outlet? Maybe you have a skill you can teach others during this time that is completely unrelated to your traditional work?Perhaps you are an excellent writer – can you reach out to clients to assist with proposal writing or scripts for online videos? What skill do you have that you probably never thought about monetising because it wasn’t you ‘real’ job. In times like this, you need to get creative and really dig deep about how you can repurpose your life right now.I am by no means minimising the devastation that is caused financially, emotionally and mentally by this epidemic. I am merely trying to provide a new perspective and tools to help people through this challenging time. So I hope I have been of service to you and request that you send this onto someone who really could use with some inspiration and hope. Here’s to all of us,Warm wishesLori"

Lori shares advice and guidance for women on navigating their way through this unprecedented time. Knowing that most women are now working from home, she offers easy and practical steps to get the most out of online meetings.So you’re at home, life has done a 360 and now you’re getting used to the ‘new normal’. I want to share some thoughts on how to show up to your meetings as your best self because this will all come to an end at some point and life will resume back to what it once was. You need to take ownership and accountability for how you conduct yourself over this period especially when it comes to your online meetings. Be punctualThere is often a common culture in companies where people feel like ‘well, everyone else always arrives 10 minutes late so why bother to get there on time?’ If you adopt this attitude during this time, remember – it impacts your image and the way you show up in other people’s minds. It sounds simple but don’t click on the Zoom link at 10am if the meeting starts at 10am. Log on 10 minutes before, check your sound and connection to ensure you can start the meeting on time and not get yourself flustered.You need to have the mind-set we are all in this together and we need to respect each other’s time. The truth is if you arrive late or make the entire team wait – or even one client or colleague – you are signalling two major things whether you intend to or not. Firstly – you are telling them through your actions that you don’t respect their time and secondly, that you are unable to plan effectively. Set an alarm to remind you 10 minutes before that the meeting is going to begin so you can get yourself ready to start with a calm, confident and ready to go attitude. PrepareMake sure there is a specific agenda for the meeting – take ownership of that to ensure there is focus and structure to the sessions. This enable others to plan, prepare and address any challenges when you have the relevant people together. The worst thing you can do in this situation is continue the chain of sitting in meetings all day and not get to your ‘actual’ work that allows you to make progress on your goals. Always make sure that the correct people are in the meeting – don’t leave out key decision makers or include people who quite frankly just don’t need to be there. Make email effectiveYour inbox is a to-do list where anyone can add an action item at any time. Not only can it derail you from your priorities but every time you check a mail, it is another decision.  When you are busy deciding what to read, delete or save for later, you are using up energy that would be better applied elsewhere. It contributes to decision fatigue and especially during this time where you are contending with family at home and a new way of being – you need to conserve your energy for the big decisions that really matter.Before you send a mail – ask yourself – is it absolutely necessary to send this person an email. Do they need to be copied? Is there a deliverable required from this person? When you have confirmed it is necessary, ensure the mail is detailed with specific information, requests that are clear what the intention of the mail is. Please – and I’ll add another please – do not send a mail that says ‘FYI’ or ‘Thoughts?’ You are making more work for team members and they may miss something important in the chain if not pointed out. Also be mindful of sending anything that is just not useful like chain mails or anything that will amplify the fear about what’s going on around us.My best advice regarding email- rather pick up the phone. You can spend 5 minutes on a phone call what would probably take 8 email chains back and forth. We are isolated so bring back the human touch where necessary. Spend a few minutes seeing how your colleagues are doing – do they need any emotional support? This is not just about being machines and micro managing tasks but creating a support system. Dress for the dayWhen you get back to the office, are you going to start arriving in your pyjamas or half dressed? So why would you even consider doing that now?Getting ready for the day is not just about your work colleagues and clients; it is a transition tool to get you from personal mode into work mode. Most of us have never had to work from home before so you need to include rituals to establish your personal time from work time. Before Covid19, you would get dressed, get to the office and once you walked through the door, you are in work mode. Once you arrive back home, you have shifted your role again. Well…hopefully you have.You need to create daily rituals to enable you to shift not only physically but mentally. Getting dressed appropriately for work is crucial. When you address colleagues and clients online – use the camera. Don’t hack the system and switch it off so you can’t be seen. And do not only dress the top of you and sit in pyjama bottoms or running shorts – you will be caught at some point. But on a serious note, if you show up dressed for your summer holiday, you are damaging a key attribute and that is trust through lack of consistency. I’m not saying get into full power suit (you can if you want) but be presentable. Think of casual Friday – how would you normally go into the office? Remember – you will be facing these clients again in person as well as your team. Show up in a way that signals to them you are capable of great things. Do not multi-taskThis is a great opportunity to practice focus and presence. When you are on a conference call, do not open a browser and check your social feed or emails at the same time. Give the person or meeting your full attention. Do not just wait for your turn to speak or give input. You think you can listen and retain information fully while engaged in another activity but multi-tasking is a myth and no one should do it.If you know yourself well and you know you are guilty of this – set up some triggers to ensure you stay focused on the meeting at hand. Close your Outlook or email program for the duration of the call, turn your phone on silent and disable the notifications for your social feeds. It is very tempting in the middle of a call to ‘just quickly’ check in because no one will know right? Treat these online meetings as if they were happening in person or pretend your boss is sitting next to you. Ask yourself – would I do this in person? The truth is people can hear if you are distracted and at some point – you will face that awkward pause when someone asks for your comments and you have no idea what was said. Show leadership in crisis and uncertaintyAmong the confusion and fear, this is truly an opportunity to shine. Despite your current role, this is your time to step up as a leader and demonstrate how you navigate this period. Put your hand up for managing the meetings, the agendas, putting together the action points. Create order and help your team make progress together. Ask yourself ‘How can I be a contribution now and add value?’ Perhaps it is something as simple as sharing links to interesting articles that would benefit the team or your clients from a work perspective. Do not send anything that will amplify the fear. Leadership is open and available to you now – it is a choice. When you get back to the office, you want to have demonstrated your strengths in uncertainty. How you show up every day to your team and clients will serve you in the long run when the dust settles. This is not only about leadership in your work capacity but leadership to your family and loved ones. Leading your kids through the day, leading your family members through fear and leading yourself through self-care is in my opinion more important. You can choose to see this situation as an opportunity and every micro decision through the day is the way through it. All you can do is choose to make the best choice in the moment and show up as the best version of you. Here’s to showing up to your meetings,Warm wishesLori"

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to Lori Milner, TedX speaker, coach, author, trainer and self-leadership expert. Lori shares advice and guidance for women on navigating their way through this unprecedented time. She starts with looking at how the equation of anxiety works and what we can do to overcome it during lockdown and beyond. This equation comes from Chip Conley’s insightful book ‘Emotional Equations’. Chip believes that the product of what you don’t know (uncertainty) and what you can’t control (powerlessness) creates the emotional condition of anxiety, which is greater than the sum of its parts.During this time, anxiety is at its highest as there are many unknowns at this stage. However despite the uncertainty, you need to ask yourself – what can I control? What do I have power over right now and let go of the things you can’t control to take back your power in whatever form possible.When you focus on the uncertainty, it leaves you feeling helpless. I want to share some thoughts on what you can focus on right now that is within your control: Strengthen your immune systemYour focus needs to be keeping your body as healthy as possible to boost your immune system.Nutrition – ensure you are consciously choosing healthy food and snacks to get the right nutrients and not reaching for high sugar snacks as a comfort. Most of us turn to sugar for a feel good boost but in these times – your body needs nourishment so choose wisely.Sleep – ensure you get at least 7.5 to 8 hours per night.  According to sleep expert, Matthew Walker, ‘Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day—Mother Nature’s best effort yet’. Replace binge watching Netflix til all hours as an escape from our reality with something more positive like reading. Alternatively, have your fix of TV but work backwards to ensure you are in bed at the right time to ensure a good 8 hours rest. Your body needs it now more than ever.Vitamins – if possible, look for additional immune boosters and probiotics to keep your gut healthy. Healthy gut = healthy mind and body. Maintain/institute a morning routineWhether you are in the office or working from home, it is imperative that you keep your existing morning routine or institute a new one. This provides you with structure and focus to your day and ensures you are taking self-care seriously. Schedule an hour every morning – preferably before the kids and family are awake to take charge of your day. This can include some exercise, journaling, meditation, studying, reading – you decide what matters most to you. This time isn’t going to magically appear in the day – you need to schedule it and honour it. This sets the tone for the entire day because it puts you into a peak state and you can now operate from this state for the rest of the day. Choose to start your day with the ingredients you need to perform at your best despite the external world. When you take an hour and start with your internal world, you have already won the day. If one hour feels unrealistic, than start with as little as 15 minutes. Manage your mind-setThis is so important during this time. You can choose where your attention goes and ultimately how you will feel as a result of it. So do you want to refresh your feeds and check your WhatsApp messages every 5 minutes which will leave you feeling anxious, drained and scared? Decide when and how often you will check in so you take your power back. If you constantly react to everyone else’s panic, you will end up in overwhelm and probably not achieve much that day.Don’t focus on fear and lack. We are all concerned and share the same fears but you can choose not to focus on this all day. When your mind starts to wonder and those negative ‘What if’ thoughts appear – choose to focus on gratitude. Take a minute and just say out loud or write down I am grateful for my health or something in your life you truly appreciate. Choose to focus on what you do have, not what you are scared you may lose. Create a success listYou can choose where to spend your time and attention. Each morning, write down 3 major tasks you want to accomplish that day. Schedule it into your calendar and commit to only doing that task for the allocated time. This is important because you need to maintain progress on your goals to give you a sense of accomplishment and power despite what it going on. If you spend your time checking the news every 10 minutes, not only will you achieve very little but you will feel a huge sense of disappointment in yourself. Progress is your secret weapon to generate your mental and emotional bandwidth. Manage your stressThis is critical. If you don’t already, bring in a practice like meditation into your daily routine. You can use Apps like Headspace to get started. Firstly, meditation brings in deep breathing which neutralizes the adrenaline in your body in addition to many other health benefits. When you have a regular meditation practice, it enables you to take control over where you attention goes. Mediation is not about ‘not having thought’s’. It is about focusing on your breath and noticing when your attention wonders. Then gently say ‘thinking’ and bring your awareness back to your breath. This is so powerful because you start to become aware of your thoughts and redirect the mind to something more positive throughout the day. You will start to become less emotionally reactive to the people and situations that normally get you worked up. We are in challenging times but the more you feel you have a sense of control despite the external, the more you will give yourself courage and strength to work through the things you have no control over. Ultimately, you always have the choice to decide how you will respond to the situations that life presents to you.I wish you strength and courage during this time, Warm wishesLori"

        "content": "1st for Women Insurance recently spoke to Lori Milner, TedX speaker, coach, author, trainer and self-leadership expert. Lori shares advice and guidance for women on navigating their way through this unprecedented time. For many women home has become an all in one – office, gym, hair salon, you name it. And boundaries inevitably blur. Lori shares how we can manage these boundaries effectively to reduce unnecessary stress.Prior to the Corona pandemic, you were battling to ‘balance’ work and life and that’s when work and life were at least separated geographically (for most of us anyway). Now you find yourself in a situation where the boundaries are completely mixed up.Your house has become your home, office, gym, school, hair salon, and dentist, – you fill in what’s missing! The way to manage your stress during this time is to manage your boundaries. Of course, there are other excellent techniques like meditation, journaling and exercise but these are about releasing and redirecting your focus or using these tools as an outlet. Once your boundaries are defined, can you really get the most out of them.I recently saw a video by Deepak Chopra who said ‘A positive mind can still be a turbulent mind’. Here are some tips and tools on how to set boundaries in your house to ensure you move from turbulence to contentment.Have a dedicated room in the house for work*Here is a disclaimer before you read further * – this is the ideal scenario but I get that it may just not be practical throughout the day. You are contending with kids, partners, spouses, other family members but if you can strive for this concept, it will go a long way to keeping you focused. I am using the patio table outside as my office most days. My husband uses the dining room as he has conference calls all day and I need a space that’s quiet for my writing, training and coaching. When I’m in this space, my brain goes into work mode. I love being outside and this boosts my energy. Try and avoid using places like the couch in front of the TV or on your bed. Keep the areas dedicated for relaxation and rest separate. I get you may need to escape to the bedroom for peace and quiet but then don’t lie down on your bed. Try set up the space to be as ‘office like’ as possible.Set up the environment for successFocus is rather challenging for us all at the moment but you can set up your environment to ensure you get your maximum output for your work time. Switch off your social media notifications when you are working. Close Outlook when you need to work as well as all news feeds and apps you have going. Unless your job is managing customer service and you are required to be on email all day. You are setting up the environment for minimal distraction and that’s key to your progress.Have a jug of water on the table, avoid too much caffeine and fizzy drinks. Have healthy snacks around you so you aren’t reaching for sugary foods to boost you. This causes havoc on your productivity because you get a sugar spike and crash eventually. Keep your blood sugar stable with better choices at hand when you need them.Have everything you need for your work session near you so you don’t have to keep getting up and walking past the family. Inevitably they will drag you into something they want to show you and there goes another 20 minutes of your time. However you decide to set up your work and rest environments, each space should trigger the mental state needed to do each type of work.Manage your kidsWe made a sign of the ‘office’ door with a happy face on one side and a sad face on the other. When the sign is facing the happy face – they know they can enter. When the sad face is showing – they know not to come in. Depending on the age of your kids – it will at least work for a while and gives them a tool to know when to give you space. You can also create a calendar for them that shows when in the day you are going to spend time with them. So perhaps the blocks from 8am to 11am is work time but lunch time is when you will see them and another block later on in the day. When kids have a visual representation to manage expectations, it helps them process the day better. Otherwise it feels like they will never have access to you and this when they start to act up.You can also involve them in this exercise and ask them what they would like to do with you today and then you can both write down in the calendar so they feel part of the decision.Have a ritual to transitionGetting ready for the day is not just about personal self-care. More than that, it is your trigger to transition from life mode to business mode. Even if you are not working but studying or a stay home mom – you need to give yourself the prompt that you are showing up for yourself and the people at home. It doesn’t really generate much motivation to those around you when you are dishing out orders to brush teeth or do chores and you haven’t even got dressed.Equally when you are done for the day, think about a ritual you can use to move back to life mode. Have a shower or long bath and change into comfortable clothes. Switch on the TV to unwind. What did you used to do when you got home from work? Maybe put on a pair of sneakers and walk around the garden or whatever area you have available. Do some running on the spot, yoga, stretches – something to reinvigorate your body and change your state. Exercise is the best way to do this. There are so many resources available on how to work out at home with no gym required.Set a quitting timeThis is probably the most important tip that will go a long way to assist with managing your stress. A few weeks ago – the narrative in most articles focused on work/life balance. Well it was a myth then and it’s a myth now. When you came home from work, you were still checking mails after hours and ‘just quickly’ working on that proposal when you should have been with the family. So it is vital that you set a quitting time at home during this period.Otherwise, the day becomes a monotonous cycle of work and trying to manage the family. Setting a quitting time is for you as well as them. You need to give yourself permission to switch off for the day and let yourself just be. Allow yourself to watch TV or play with the kids without the guilt. It was bad enough you had guilt when you weren’t home all day. You decide what your quitting time is and then put the laptop and phone down. Do an activity you enjoy, read a book, and do something for you. Maybe you only have 15 minutes because you have to make dinner or get the kids ready for bed. But make sure you schedule time in your day for yourself.This is challenging enough as it is but to feel guilty when you are not ‘being productive’ at this time, will drive you insane and make this period unbearable. Another consideration is that you are probably not achieving as much as you would in a typical day because you have to contend with family at home despite not having travel time. Accept it. Don’t start the internal narrative that you don’t deserve to switch off because it felt like you achieved nothing in the day.The more you can set boundaries and set up your work time for maximum progress, the happier you will feel. Don’t focus on the huge task or goal at this stage – break it down into tiny chunks and everyday commit to doing the best you can.Set boundaries on when and how often you check mail, news and messagesIf you spend all day responding to everyone else’s agenda – you will get nothing done of your own. Some people thrive in this chaos and they want to read and share every new stat and article they come across. Now you do not need to be sucked into this. You set the boundaries on when and how often you will check these interruptions.For example, check email mid-morning, at lunchtime and mid-afternoon. Manage your team and tell them that if they need you urgently, they must phone you. There is the fear mentality that if you don’t check your mail every 20 minutes you will miss something urgent. This is not productive. It destroys creativity, deep thinking and focus. If you saw this morning there are 709 new cases, then don’t go into the new feeds until you are done with your work day. It is not going to make a difference in those few hours. If you check in every hour, all you are doing is taking away from your productive time and getting yourself worked up into panic and fear. I’m not saying ignore what’s happening but you have limited time as it is – make the wisest choice of what you can do in each moment.The same goes for WhatsApp and messages. I’m sure you are part of several groups – for school, personal, work, etc. Mute the social or family chats when you need to get stuff done and check in when you are ready to. Again – set boundaries and tell your family and friends – ‘I need to get stuff done so call me if you need me’. Most of these chats are filled with the same stuff because everyone is sharing the same articles, latest news and cat videos. You don’t need that to fill your days. All that will happen is you reflect on the day having done mindless work instead of moving the needle on your goals and priorities.Equally important – try not to message people after hours especially in the evening if its work related. You will only stress your team and your colleagues out more. Or if this is when you can only get your work done because of the kids – then stipulate that in the email. ‘I am working on this now but no need to respond until tomorrow’. That consideration will go leaps and bounds to ensuring we all get through this with the least possible chronic stress.Stress is not going away, it is a part of life. Prevention is the best cure to stress so set up your boundaries but do this as a family. We are all in this together – ask your partner or spouse where they prefer to be and perhaps take turns for certain areas depending on what kind of work needs to happen that day. Make the kids feel included and specify the areas they can use for homework and playing.The mantra is one day at a time; some days these tools will work and some days it will inevitably go pear shaped. But the one thing you can control is your quitting time. Honour yourself and make sure you respect your time as much as everyone else.Here’s to teamwork,Warm wishes Lori"

        "description": "",
        "content": "Almost overnight the way many of us work has had to change. To help flatten the curve of the Corona virus, the routine and structure of daily life has been turned upside down. And for most women, working from home has become a reality, as have the challenges that come with it. The early school holidays compounded by disruptions in childcare is exceptionally challenging for moms. We’ve got you covered with these 10 top tips for working productively at home. 1.    Ensure you have all the tech you needWorking collaboratively is critically important in many businesses. This requires the use of technology to facilitate engagement and the sharing of important information. So, make sure that the system used in your business can be run seamlessly from home to ensure there is limited disruption in communication or accessing of important documents and reports. Test these systems both at the office and at home to ensure that everything is working as it should. Make sure everyone understands and agrees upon the methods of working and the systems used. 2.    Create a dedicated workspaceIf you already have a home office or study, it’s easy enough to shut the door, set up and get started. If you don’t, avoid the temptation of that living room couch. See if you can set up a make-shift office space in a room of the house, with a table and chair where you can sit comfortably, without distractions or temptations like the TV or Netflix. 3.    Follow your usual schedule, where possibleIf you usually arrive at work at 8:00, grab a coffee at 8:30, break for lunch at 1:00, and have a few other smaller breaks throughout the day, then keep doing that. Wake up at your usual time, get dressed as you usually would for the office and make sure you’re in front of your desk and online by 8:00. It may be tempting to stay in bed and just pop open your laptop, still in your PJs. But that’s not the structure or environment conducive to a productive day’s work, so try and replicate your usual schedule as much as possible at home. If you have children at home, flexibility will be required, and your structure will need to change within reason. 4.    Communicate with your partner and childrenThe current situation probably  means that both parents are working at home. In that case, determine a schedule around the expectations of each of your jobs, the daily running of the household and responsibilities of children. If you have a conference call or are working on tight deadline, ask your partner, if they can keep the kids fully occupied during that time. Just as importantly, communicate with your children. Explain the situations where you can’t have any interruptions. For example, what should they do when your phone rings? Perhaps there’s a secret signal you can use. Do some fun ‘drills’ with them so they get the idea. 5.    Schedule quality time with your kids If you set aside dedicated time to spend with your kids, giving them your full focus and attention, they may be less likely to hassle you when you need to work. So, for example, set aside a dedicated time in the time exclusively for them, close your laptop, put your phone away and enjoy some time catching up with them. Communicate your daily schedules with your boss and colleagues through a shared calendar, so that everyone knows when you are and aren’t available.Flexibility and adaptability are, of course, critical as meetings and deadlines will need to be managed and negotiated accordingly. 6.    Get creative, use what you have and ditch the guilt With many of us stocking up at the shops, why not put all those egg cartons to good use? If you spend a few minutes with the kids coming up with a creative activity, with a purpose, it will give you the crucial time you need to have an uninterrupted conference call or finish that urgent presentation. For example, ask them to make you a long centipede out of all those egg cartons and have it ready and painted for you by the time you’re done. You can even use an egg timer, so they know how much time they have. Of course, crafts don’t always do the trick and Netflix is a saviour for many parents – so don’t feel guilty for a second if a movie or series and a bowl of popcorn is what’s going to keep them occupied. 7.    Keep up connections Working away from the office actually frees up a lot time – less time commuting to work, less time spent in meetings and less water cooler chats. But there’s a flip side to this too as a lack of social connection may also leave you feeling unmotivated and isolated - especially if you’re a person who thrives in a busy and interactive environment. The good news is that with so many apps and programmes at our disposal, it’s easy to hop onto a video call and touch base with your co-workers at a moment’s notice. 8.    Use your time wiselyWith more time on your hands comes the need for more discipline in how you plan and spend your day. For many of us, there is a time of day when our energy tends to drop. So why not use that time to get a few chores done and give your mind a break? As long as it doesn’t interfere with critical work delivery or meetings, it’s a good way to make use of time you’d otherwise spend scrolling social media or battling to focus on a task. Another great use of time is reading and learning. If there’s an interesting talk you’ve been meaning to watch or a short course you want to do, use the extra time you have for this kind of enriching activity. And what about personal admin you’ve been putting off? Like checking your insurance is up to date? When was the last time you did a home inventory to ensure you’re correctly covered? It’s not always easy to do these things in a busy office when you’re constantly distracted by meetings or interrupted with questions or phone calls. 9.    Get in those steps For those who work in large offices, there’s usually a fair amount of walking in your day. From the brisk walk from your car to your desk to rushing between meetings, even walking a good distance to the kitchen or toilet. At home, none of this applies. This lack of exercise combined with being cooped up with our families, can work on our nerves. Since many gyms have shut down, why not do some fun at home exercise with the whole family? Stream a yoga or aerobics class in the  living  or even do jumping jacks on the spot  . That way, you can all get out some of that pent-up frustration and energy and spend quality time together too. 10.    Eat mindfully, drink plenty of water  Keeping ourselves and our families healthy is priority, especially now. So, make sure what’s in your fridge and cupboards is nutrient-rich, filling and enjoyable. If you have lots of sugary snacks at your disposal, you’re likely to grab them, especially when you’re frustrated or bored. A good alternative is to use that time to Google healthy family meals and snacks and make them. Get the kids to help too. It’s another way you can spend quality and purposeful time together. If part of your workday includes a water bottle on your desk, keep that great habit up at home. Add some lemon, mint or strawberries to the water for a little extra flavour. Whether you thrive on working from home or dread the very idea, our current reality requires a change in many of our daily norms. As women, we are incredibly resilient and by taking just a few practical measures we’ll not only survive our new normal but thrive within it."

        "content": "Women are doing incredible things, propelling the world forward in so many ways, despite the fact that gender inequality persists. This year’s International Women’s Day theme addresses this contradictory reality – both celebrating the achievements of women and raising awareness against bias, challenging stereotypes and taking action for equality. The hashtag #EachforEqual, is drawn from a notion that collective action and shared responsibility is key to driving a gender equal world. And nowhere in the world is this more necessary than in South Africa.The International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) 2018/2019 Global Wage Report states that in South Africa, women continue to be paid 28% less than men.  Even more alarming is that South Africa has the world’s highest pay inequality overall. So, while women are breaking more boundaries than ever before, they continue to be underpaid, and mothers get paid even less.Furthermore the ‘motherhood gap’ sees moms earning less than women without children.  In South Africa, the gap is estimated to be 1%. On the other hand, fatherhood is associated with a pay increase.A survey conducted by CareerJunction revealed that almost 60% of men feel that South Africa still has a long way to go until we reach gender equality.  Women’s feelings on this are much stronger at 72%. And while 39% of women said that their gender has negatively impacted them in the workplace, this is only true for 17% of men.According to the ILO, unless the present trajectory is changed, unless policy choices are made that put gender equality at their core, the situation is likely to deteriorate further as work becomes more fragmented and the future remains uncertain.With this in mind, 1st for Women Insurance is encouraging women to recognise and attain their worth: Knowledge is power: Pay transparency is key. Do the necessary research to ensure that what you are currently being paid is aligned to your market value. There are many websites to help you accurately estimate this.Make the case: If you feel you’re deserving of more, prepare a case to present to the decision makers.Keep a record of your achievements: From day one in a new job, note down your accomplishments and successes. This will serve as a powerful tool to help you negotiate a raise.Can you quantify your contribution? Your strongest argument will be made with facts: numbers-based evidence of how your work has improved the company’s financial position. If you can make an evidence-based argument that the decision makers are better off with you and that you are worth the extra money, it will be very hard for them to say no.How much will it cost to replace you? Part of knowing your worth is knowing how much it would cost to replace you. If you have been with a company for a period, you have performed and added value to that company, and you think you are not getting what you’re worth then it may be time to think in these terms. One fool proof way of doing it is to apply for another position with increased benefits and be truly willing to leave if you don’t get what you believe you should. It is a very strong position from which to enter negotiations and in some cases, will be the necessary wake-up call to your company for how much they stand to lose.Don’t make it personal: If you personalise the issue too much and confuse it with your own estimations of self-worth you run the risk of saying things which might negatively affect your relationship with your employers. The reality is that if you are worth what you think you are, someone else will pay it, if your current company refuses to.Timing is key: It’s human nature to be more open to requests when things are going well. So, think about your timing. A good time would be, for example, just after you’ve won a new contract for the company or just after you have been instrumental in helping a deal come together under time pressure.Prepare well. Know your worth but be realistic about it too. Be calm and open to offers but persistent in looking for what you deserve.Ultimately, it’s imperative that South African women know their worth and if they are not getting paid the same amount, for the same role as their male counterpart, that they speak up. The more open we are in terms of addressing the challenges and limitations, the more we can work together to find the appropriate solutions to end gender inequality."

        "content": "For 16 Days of Activism we shone a light on woman abuse – remembering the past to give power to the present through moving tributes that celebrate the lives lost to abuse. But remembering is not enough. 16 days is not enough. That’s why we’ll keep the light shining for 365 days a year, every year. In fact, we’ve been shining the light on this dark subject for over 14 years. Through the 1st for Women Foundation, we have raised over R70 million for woman abuse causes and assisted over 90 000 survivors to date – a permanent beacon of hope in the ongoing battle against woman abuse. A battle that was finally declared a national crisis. We live in what our President has called \"one of the most unsafe places in the world to be a woman\"1. A country where a woman is murdered every three hours2 and where 52 420 sexual offences were reported in just 365 days3.  The horrific events that occurred this year were the tipping point for South Africa.  They also prompted us to re-evaluate our Foundation’s approach to fighting woman abuse and launch a new preventative and response programme that takes into account and addresses the root cause of the epidemic. Although the Foundation has done tremendous work, we believe it can have an even greater impact in the future. And as woman abuse in South Africa is a complex issue, one that requires a multifaceted approach to address the underlying attitudes, beliefs, practices and systems that condone, justify or excuse gender inequality, we need a multifaceted solution going forward. In developing its new strategy and to support its approach, we turned to the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and tackle climate change by 2030 (SDG), Africa’s Agenda 2063, South Africa’s National Development Plan and Urie Bronfenbrenner\"s Ecological Framework. Through our research we found that male superiority and a culture of violence which manifests itself in the form of patriarchy, control, sexual entitlement and unhealthy conflict resolution skills are determining factors towards woman abuse.  This was confirmed through research conducted in six gender-based violence hotspots in South Africa, where it was found that patriarchy is the biggest driver of woman abuse in South Africa.We also found that a prevention and response approach to addressing woman abuse in South Africa is critical. We believe that education is a fundamental tool in the fight for gender equality and will be launching a school-based learning programme at 20 registered Early Childhood Development (ECD) Centres and five Primary and High Schools in the Diepsloot community for children aged three to 18.  The programme also includes a comprehensive community-based support programme for survivors of abuse (from trauma to prosecution) which is currently being implemented with Lawyers Against Abuse in Diepsloot.  Self-defence training and a digital tool will be integrated into the programme at a later stage. Diepsloot was selected as it has some of the highest rates of violence against women ever recorded in South Africa - more than double those reported in national studies.  A national roll-out will be considered following a successful pilot in Diepsloot. Our implementation partners for ECD learners include Think Equal, the first global education initiative endorsed by the UN Human Rights Office and the Ntataise Trust, an independent organisation that helps women in disadvantaged, rural communities gain the knowledge and skills needed to establish and sustain effective ECD programmes for children in their care. Through this programme, learners will be equipped with social and emotional intelligence and values-based skills to end discriminatory mindsets and the cycle of violence.  REPSSI (Regional Psychosocial Support Initiative), a leading African psychosocial support organisation has been selected to roll-out the Primary and High School programme. The programme includes self-esteem, physical alertness and body consciousness training for girls and the ‘Peace is a Decision Programme’ for boys, which is focused on training and equipping boys with the necessary social courage to challenge cultural norms that condone violence against women and girls, and to intervene when girls and women are being abused. REPSSI will also provide training for parents, caregivers, teachers and school leaders. Woman abuse is a dark subject. It happens in the dark.  When it\"s not reported, it stays in the dark.  That’s why we’re committed to bringing it into the light and keeping it there because it is only with constant illumination that the subject will remain in focus – not just for 16 days but for 365 days a year, every year. 1http://www.sabcnews.com/sabcnews/sa-is-one-of-the-most-unsafe-places-in-the-world-for-a-woman-to-live-ramaphosa/ 2https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news-fast-news/woman-murdered-every-three-hours-in-south-africa-stokes-protests/ 3https://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/bheki-cele-details-plan-to-tackle-gender-based-violence-in-south-africa/"

        "content": "It’s that time of year, things slow down, and it’s the ideal time for us to wind down, put our feet up and relax. And the atmosphere is just perfect – festive lights are up, schools are almost out, annual leave is on the cards and the daily routine is almost out the window. So, whether you’re at home or away these holidays, the idea is the same – switch off, let go of all the expectations and pressures of the year and fully embrace the days away from the daily grind. Here are a few inspirational ideas in addition to your plans for the festive season. 1. Fabulous feastingWhen it comes to bringing people together – food is the key. Whether it’s the smoky scent of meat on the braai, a roasting turkey or a meal at one of your favourite restaurants, your taste buds will be in for a treat. And if you’re looking for some divine places to try, we’ve sourced a few like the Deck Restaurant in Johannesburg, Chef’s Table in Durban and Belly of the Beast in Cape Town. 2. Musical moments From parties and concerts to live music, we’ve got you covered with some great suggestions. The first one is the annual December Afropunk – a two-day event with artists from all over the world. One of the biggest artists on this year’s line-up is the American Pop star Miguel who will be joined by many other artists. It’s a fun outdoor event you can enjoy with friends. And if you are looking for something to enjoy with family – The East Rand Family Expo is a fun event  that caters for both children of all ages and adults – plus, the entrance is free. 3. Holiday reading When last did you read a book? Get some inspiration during your holiday break. Shonda Rhimes’s Year of yes – a memoir that is filled with many life lessons that will definitely help you leap into 2020 prepared to take anything on. And for a little bit of humour, Holly Bourne’s How Do You Like Me Now?  is the perfect read for you. Lastly, get to know our very own Basetsana Kumalo as she shares her life story in her book titled Bassie My Journey of Hope. 4. A Spa Escape Indulge in a spa treatment with the girls – get a massage by the pool, sip on cocktails and enjoy catching up. Book a facial, pedicure, manicure and chill in the steam room. This is one of the best ways to ease up and unwind. There are many spas that provide different packages from half to full day packages. One of the spas with branches in most parts of SA is Life Day Spa. There’s one in Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg and Bloemfontein. The best thing about a spa day is that you can go with your partner, friends, family or on your own. 5. Go unplugged Technology tends to keep us very busy and that’s okay because the world is becoming more and more digital. However, during your holiday, if you find that you’re unable to switch off or fully relax with your gadgets on – unplug from the online world and live in the moment. Have an uninterrupted day with loved ones, share a good laugh and make new memories. 6. Vacation or StaycationWhether you’ve planned to stay at home or booked a flight to a different destination – there’s always something for everyone. For those going abroad – this is a perfect time for you to learn a different language, try a variety of foods and meet new people. And for those visiting some exciting destinations in SA, don’t forget to take in all the culture and beauty our country has to offer. And lastly, if you’re staying in – you can binge on Christmas movies, cook a good meal for yourself, extend your sleep hours and enjoy the long baths.And there you have it, some great ways to spend this festive season – we hope that you enjoy every moment and make the very best memories.

With stats like 1 in 3 SA women will be raped in her lifetime*, the epidemic of woman abuse persists. Although shockingly evident, woman abuse remains a dark subject. It happens in the dark.  When it\"s not reported, it stays in the dark. That’s why we’re committed to bringing it into the light – and keeping it there because it is only with constant illumination that the subject will remain in focus.  Follow us into the light this 16 Days of Activism at: www.for-women.co.za/sixteendays.co.za and on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. And more importantly, take action to keep the light shining 365 days a year – with our initiatives which support the fight against woman abuse and benefits designed specifically for our customers (if you or your loved ones need help) and some which are available to all South African women. Here’s a reminder of what these are: 1. 1st for Women Foundation – a community of women supporting women. A portion of all our customers’ premiums goes to the Foundation, which to date has raised over R70 million for woman abuse causes and helped over 90 000 survivors. 2. ForWomen – our online platform that unites woman abuse fighting efforts, where all South Africans can make a pledge, give help or get help in the fight against woman abuse. 3. The 1 Move – an easy self-defence technique that could immobilise a perpetrator, giving you enough time to escape if you’re in a life-threatening situation. Learn it here. 4. Health and safety benefits – we offer our customers and their loved ones access to trauma counselling and emergency medical assistance among other benefits. Every action is taken – that monthly donation, that pledge made, that help given or received, that 1 Move learnt – all help keep woman abuse in the light.

        "content": "As women we juggle it all — dedicating some time to unwind and relax can be tricky.  So, whether you’ve set specific fitness goals or just want to get your blood pumping and stay in shape, we’ve got you covered with a wide variety of exercise routines.  From stretch and tone to full-on sprint, there are hundreds of ways to exercise and make you feel good. 1. Stretch. Tone. Balance.  If you like your space and don’t enjoy the confines of a gym — why not try yard yoga? It’s one of the most soothing and relaxing exercises you can enjoy alone or with a group of friends and you can do it in the comfort of your home. According to Yoga Journal each time you practice yoga, you take your joints through their full range of motion. It also helps with blood circulation as well as getting oxygen in your cells.   2. Pedal up from tar to trail   Unlike some exercise routines, cycling doesn’t require high levels of fitness and it’s a fun way to get fit — especially if you’re an adventurous outdoor person. It’s also a very sociable exercise – perfect for meeting new people. One of the most popular cycling groups from Cape Town is called Bicycle South. It accommodates children of different ages and provides a variety of cycling routines for everyone to enjoy.  3.  Hit that road   Running is an easy way to stay fit. However, completing a 15-minute jog can be challenging if you’re new to the routine. If you’ve been procrastinating — there’s no need to put pressure on yourself. Start by taking walks, and slowly work yourself up to run a few kilometres, before you know it, you’ll be a pro. 4. Discover your hiking trail Go on a hiking adventure and take in the fresh air — while appreciating all the beauty offered by nature. It’s an inexpensive activity you can do on your own or with a group. And because kids are natural explorers — it can be a fun and different learning experience if they have never seen a lake, waterfall or been around a mountainous area. 5. Bust that move  Zumba. Hip-hop. Ballroom. Whatever makes your feet move — there’s something for everyone. Dancing is a fun way to burn calories. You don’t have to be a professional dancer — and not only are they lots of fun – but you can take a partner for some motivation. There are also different dance exercise videos available online for you to enjoy and help you start your day on a high.   6. Walk your way to fitness Walking is one of the most underrated exercises. It is by far the easiest exercise to do and requires no specific location. However, like any other exercise, it requires discipline especially if you’re doing it to improve your health. Most smartphones now have health apps that track and count the steps you take.Now that you’ve got some ideas to get you started, prepare to exercise in style — courtesy of adidas. Kit up from head to toe with stylish workout wear.

Ever stood in front of a closet full of clothes and felt like you had nothing to wear? Well then, you’ll relate to Tess.Tess has something big coming up. Bigger and better than anything she’s ever experienced. But it’s keeping her up. As the hours tick past – her mind races. Questions and more questions arise, like: a closet full of clothes but what to wear? These ‘buts’ have got Tess’s mind in a twist.Watch episode 1 of Tess &amp; the head-buts and find out how she kicks these ‘buts’.We also asked the women of SA: what’s got them contemplating their closet? The answers were interesting, funny and insightful. Here are just a few examples:“After four outfit changes you finally find something that kind of works and you just go with it.”“Well when you have no closet space left, you have to start placing your clothes in baskets and leaving them in the bags you bought them in. Also, the chest of drawers you thought would help and bring space gave up on you and broke. Though funny enough I still don’t know what to wear or feel like I have nothing to wear.”“I have learnt my lesson when it comes to deciding what to wear to work in the morning. You had it figured out then in the morning when you actually try it on, it’s not how you thought it would be. So, you search and try something else and when you suddenly look up it’s 07:30 and you need to be in the office at 08:00. So, I always prepare my outfits just before I go to bed.”Kick your what-to-wear buts with these winter wardrobe inspirations. Here’s what’s hot in SA right now.1.

According to a global survey by Vodafone, one in five South African teenagers has been victimised.In many cyber bullying cases, fast and effective legal intervention can minimise the effects of this abusive behaviour.

In addition, we’re running an informative blog series to empower parents with the information and tools needed to deal with cyber bullying, and keep their children safe online.In addition to taking out Cyber Insurance, it’s critical that parents know exactly what cyber bullying is, the different types of cyber bullying and the warning signs to look out for. The below tips will be helpful to parents whose children have been victimised. 10 tips to address cyber bullying Create a space of safety and trust – your children should know that their safety is your top priority and that they can confide in you about anything. Set limits when it comes to their online activities and explain why you are doing this i.e. to protect their safety online.Know what they know – familiarise yourself with social networking sites and how they work. ‘Friend’ or ‘follow’ your children on these sites but only to observe and not to comment. If you’re concerned about interactions you witness on their accounts, talk to them about it offline.Engage in open, honest discussions – if they’re being bullied, address the situation in a calm manner, listen carefully to exactly what has happened. Don’t minimise the issue or excuse the bully’s behavior.Don’t overreact or underreact – both can be harmful and can make the situation worse. Remain calm, listen to them carefully about how the situation has transpired to understand how and when the bullying started and to full gauge its severity. Your calm and supportive attitude will be imperative in the way they manage the situation.Instill the ‘don’t respond rule – once your child is aware that they are being bullied, they should know not to respond to cyber bullying threats, comments or messages – but not to delete them either until the evidence is preserved.Preserve evidence – this is imperative. Take screen shots of any online interaction including messages, videos, memes, photos, etc. to back up a cyber bullying claim. Keep a record of these and any other details that may be helpful e.g. frequency, severity of the harm caused, a back story to the bullying, etc.Seek counselling – your child may feel more comfortable talking to a third party about bullying and consulting with a school or independent counsellor may be beneficial. For expert advice and assistance, visit SaveTNet.  Prevent further bullying – One of the benefits of our cyber bullying cover is the removal and suppression of harmful content. This will go a long way in preventing the bullying messages from spreading and prevent further harm to your child. You can also put measures in place like setting privacy controls on all social pages and block the account which the cyber bully is using.Refrain from confronting the bully’s parents – the bully’s parents may become defensive and may not take kindly to accusations that their child is a bully. It may be a good idea to consult with the school counsellor for guidance and mediation.Know when to contact the police – if physical threats are made, contact the police immediately. Being prepared to address cyber bullying is as important as ensuring that you and your loved ones are covered with Cyber Insurance – which includes not only cyber bullying cover but cover for other prevalent cyber risks: cyber liability insurance, cyber theft insurance and recovery of lost data.All of these cover benefits are available to you, your spouse and up to four dependent children, up to the age of 21, for only R99 a month.

This reality hit home, hard, with the recent suicide of an 11-year-old girl, from a school in Johannesburg, who committed suicide as a result of cyberbullying. Countless children and teenagers are experiencing the ripple effects of this abusive behaviour, and many are battling anxiety and depression as a result.In many cyberbullying cases, decisive legal action must be taken to stop the abuse and bring the perpetrators to justice.

        "content": "With our beloved South African sunshine around the corner, we got to thinking about our summer bodies. That’s why we decided to explore how to ditch one of the worst offenders when it comes to poor health – sugar.In the last few years, sugar’s gained a bad rap, and there are conflicting reports on just how bad it is for you. Some studies suggest that it’s as addictive as hard drugs, while others show that this may not be the case. One thing we do know is: too much of the stuff is really bad for you.It’s in everything. Cold drinks, alcohol, cakes, chocolates, sweets, biscuits, and your tea and coffee. If you check the labels on mayonnaise or chutney, they’re loaded with sugar. Sometimes it seems like, unless you’ve made it from scratch, everything you put in your body is loaded with that deliciously addictive substance.So, quitting sugar isn’t as easy as simply not putting any in your cappuccino.Those who have ditched sugar have reported various effects on their bodies, ranging from amazing benefits to downright awful withdrawals. Some of the not-so-sweet changes you might expect to see soon after quitting sugar are:headachesfatiguecravingsanxietymood swingsinsomniaBut once you’ve gone a week or two without it, you should start to feel more like your best self. Once you’re over the initial withdrawal, some of the benefits include:mental clarityincreased energyimproved skinweight lossimproved moodbetter sleepIf you’ve got a serious sugar obsession, it might be holding you back from being at your best, considering sugar makes your energy levels spike and drop through the day. So while we know you’re doing great and smashing goals, a little less sugar could give you a lot more oomph steadily throughout the day.If you’ve been thinking of cutting out sugar from your diet, or just finding a way to consume less of it, here are some practical tips to get you through the first few weeks.Step 1: Evict itSugar doesn’t pay rent in your house, so kick it out. It’s got plenty of other places it can stay. This means you need to get rid of everything that contains sugar, which will likely be most of your condiments and sauces. Luckily, there are alternatives for many of your favourite foods, such as sugar- and salt-free peanut butter and unsweetened plain yoghurt. If you’ve got a sweet craving that can’t be denied, eat a piece of fruit. While fruit contains sugar, it also has a load of other vitamins that are good for you; just don’t overdo it.Step 2: Make small substitutionsThere are countless sugar substitutes on the market that can help ease you out of your sugar addiction, but try to use these as a bridge to becoming sugar-free, rather than sticking to them full-time. Studies have shown that sugar substitutes have been linked to increased visceral fat and weight gain, and while they do play an important role in health, particularly for diabetics, it’s best to consume them in moderation.Step 3: Go slow and steady Because of the horrible withdrawal symptoms that you might face, it’s a good idea to quit gradually. Start by giving up, say, soft drinks, or little by little, reduce the amount of sugar you add to your tea or coffee each week. If you do this with a weekly goal, you’ll find yourself quickly ditching most sugar without the hectic downsides.Step 4: Eat a balanced dietOne of the best ways to stop a sugar craving before it even starts is to eat a balanced diet of protein, healthy fats, and fibre. Protein helps to stabilise your blood sugar levels, your body will burn fat when you’ve cut out sugar, and fibre will help you feel fuller for longer. If you’ve cut out sugar or simply reduced your intake of it, share this blog through the social buttons below, tag us, and tell us how consuming less of it has made you feel. We’d love to hear your stories!Also remember that, while too much sugar can harm your health, your body still needs a certain amount of glucose to function properly, so make sure you still get your daily dose, preferably from a healthy source like fruits or milk products.

        "content": "Did you just experience a bad day on your entrepreneurial journey or is that nagging feeling in the back of your mind telling you it’s time for some serious reflection of your business career? Either way it’s best to be prepared to make the difficult decisions and do your homework, just in case.Everybody has days at work that make them want to crawl back into bed. But Candice Clark, who runs a career and business coaching outfit, says if those terrible days outnumber the good, then it’s time to take stock.\"I think the situation that a lot of women find themselves in is they are doing things they are skilled at, but which they don\"t particularly enjoy doing,” says Clark.In these situations, you can feel drained, de-motivated and stressed. The ideal situation is what Cark refers to as the ‘sweet spot’ in your business life. That is, thriving by doing work that you enjoy and are good at.\"When I say thriving, it means that your career gives more to you than it takes away from you. You\"re energised and you\"re in flow,\" says Clark.But in order to reach this point, you need to identify the warning signs that are holding you back.The first warning sign is that you may be highly skilled at what you do in your business, but you\"re not enjoying it anymore.The second is that you may enjoy what you’re doing, but you don\"t feel particularly skilled or talented at the work, which can make you feel anxious or incompetent.Thirdly, if your bad days outnumber the really good days, then you need to take stock. Out of 20 working days in a month, if you enjoy less than 15 days that’s a sign to move on or to shift things in your current work life.However, even if you\"ve grappled through the warning signs and found a business area that you thrive in, it’s important to remember that every type of work will have its moments.Clark says in any work you do an 80-10-10 rule should be considered. That is, enjoying and being confident in what you\"re doing should make up 80% of your time, 10% should be for tasks that aren\"t enjoyable and another 10% for those that you aren\"t confident in yet.Changing your business focus also doesn\"t mean taking a knock in your earnings, as Clark says she’s yet to see this with a single client of hers.Obviously, activities such as travelling the world may not always cut it from an earnings perspective, but Clark says if you want to keep your financial circumstances similar or slightly increased, you need to focus on finding your ‘sweet spot’ — doing work that you enjoy and are good at.At whatever stage you are in, consulting a career coach is always a helpful exercise.“If you see the right kind of career coach, they will give you skills that you can repeat long into your career,” says Clark.Clark runs the Candice Clark Collective and previously worked in a top talent acquisition role for a listed company. Contact her at www.candiceclarkcollective.com.Gareth van Zyl is the deputy managing editor at BizNews.com. Prior to this he was also the Bureau Chief for Fin24.com’s Johannesburg office. A former tech journalist, Gareth now spends most of his days interviewing top CEOs, businesspeople and thought leaders in South Africa and across the globe."

Fortunately, with preparation and increased vigilance, there are things you can do to help keep yourself and your family safe from smash-and-grab attacks.Tips to prevent a smash-and-grab attack Smash-and-grab film fitting – having this film fitted to your windows is possibly the best preventative measure as it makes it extremely difficult to shatter your windows, which in turn also helps prevent injuries from smashed glass.Open windows slightly – Leaving your passenger windows open by just three centimetres will make the glass more flexible, allowing the window to absorb the sudden impact of an attempted smash-and-grab.Keep valuables out of sight – valuables, or anything worth stealing, that’s visible on your passenger or back seat could attract the attention of potential smash-and-grab thieves. So put all your valuables, especially your handbag, in the boot or under your seat.Stay on high alert at “hot spots” – because street intersections, stop signs and driveways are regarded as smash-and-grab “hot spots” remain on full alert and avoid being distracted when approaching or stopping at one of these.Leave room to manoeuvre – when approaching an intersection, leave a reasonable stopping distance between you and the car in front of you. This will allow you room to manoeuvre and escape a dangerous situation.Keep your hand close to the hooter – when at a traffic light or stop street, if you need to alert others that you’re in trouble, this will help attract attention quickly.Go slow to get the green light – when approaching a red traffic light at night, slow down so that you only reach it when it turns green. This will avoid you from becoming a sitting target. The six golden rules to follow if confronted by a smash-and-grabber Remain calm.Don’t argue.Don’t make sudden gestures.Avoid eye contact but try, if you can, to remember what the criminal looks like by identifying and remembering special features.Comply with the smash-and-grabber’s directions (within reason). What to do if you witness a smash-and-grab attack: Alert the authorities immediately – even if you only see suspicious-looking individuals at an intersection, let the authorities know.Don’t confront the smash-and-grabbers – they may be armed and further confrontation could risk not only the life of the victim but also your own.Stay where you are – only leave the scene, or create distance between yourself and the smash-and-grabbers, when it is safe to do so.Try to remember details for the authorities – taking note of details, like which direction the criminals escaped in, or the criminal’s facial features could help the authorities find and identify them.Another preparative measure is to ensure that you have adequate vehicle cover and portable possessions insurance in place so that if you do experience a smash-and-grab, the lost items can be replaced as soon as possible.

        "content": "An increasing number of women use LPGas (Liquid Petroleum Gas) for various reasons every day, whether for cooking, space heating or as an energy alternative in their businesses. With the weather being so cold, the use of gas, especially in the home is increasing, but unfortunately, if safety guidelines are not followed, gas can be potentially harmful.  As a result, the potential for fire-related incidents increases as many of us try to keep warm.Being gas compliant is essential, this helps minimise the likelihood of fires and explosions in your business and home.  Although 1st for Women Insurance can cover your home and business against fire damage, it is also important for you to protect your home or business and put preventable measures in place.  Being proactive can save you a lot of heartaches.   Take note of the following safety precautions when using any LPGas appliances; Safe Gas Appliances  We use gas to prepare warm hearty meals and keep our homes warm, to ensure a safe environment for family and kids.  You should only buy appliances that have a Permit Verification Number displayed on them. This means that the appliances have been tested and are in compliance with the relevant South African safety standards and are fit for the intended use. A list of all permit carrying appliances can be found on: https://bit.ly/2Jj7wp3 Installing Gas Equipment   As per South African law, only a registered Gas practitioner may install gas appliances or equipment. A comprehensive list of registered installers is available on: www.saqccgas.co.za where practitioners can be located by town and suburb.When having gas installed in a commercial property, ensure the installer is registered for commercial installations and is qualified for the specific size required.Always turn your heater off at the cylinder valve before going to bed or leaving your office – in fact, at any time when the heater is not in use.When changing the cylinder, first close the cylinder valve and then remove the regulator.Test any gas appliance or heater for possible leaks by spraying a soap-water solution on all connections. Leaks will show in the form of bubbles and must be repaired immediately.In the workplace, ensure that your commercial space heater is positioned away from any flammable materials and is not blocking any escape route.Never place clothes or other items on or near your heater.Do not move your unit while it is in use.If you suspect a gas leak, turn off the gas cylinder immediately and, if possible, take the heater outside.In order to receive maximum benefits from the efficiency of LPG appliances, it is important to ensure that all safety guidelines are closely followed. This will, in turn, warrant a reliable and efficient energy supply.For more information visit: www.lpgas.co.za where you will also find a short instruction video on the safe use of LPGas Roll-About heaters.

You grab your car charger and handbag, and you’re out the door. “I’m so excited!”, you think to yourself. “A nice restaurant with some good company – just what I need”. You’re not even halfway when a very suspicious sound emerges from below your car. Then a rattle. Then a jolt. Then a stall. “Well, there goes lunch!”Life happens. But you can’t let that stop you from going places. If you ever find yourself in a sticky situation with your car, and you need to take it to a workshop, you can go prepared with these tips.Make sure you are using a qualified, reputable mechanic. Ask friends and family members for recommendations.Do some research online to gauge what might be wrong with your vehicle. The more information you can give the mechanic, the better.Make an appointment. Just in case. A good tip is to make the appointment for mid-week. Mechanics are likely to be less busy and will give your vehicle the attention it deserves.Take someone along who might ask the questions you forget to ask.Having your car fixed can be very expensive. Request a detailed breakdown of the costs before they start working on your vehicle. You might be paying for things that aren’t necessary.Don’t simply nod in agreement – you are allowed to ask questions. The most important questions normally relate to what caused the problem, the cost of the repair and the time it will take to fix the car. Also ask about a workmanship guarantee.Read any quotes or authorisation forms before you sign.If you prefer to get a second opinion, do not tell the second mechanic what the first quote was. This way you can be sure they remain objective and honest.Test drive your vehicle when the repairs are done, before you make the final payment.Go prepared, but trust the qualified, professional mechanic. Your safety and a running vehicle is most important, so if you feel unsure, give us a call and we’ll help you find a workshop.Sources:http://www.knockoutengine.com/what-to-say-to-your-auto-mechanic/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2012/06/18/five-dos-and-donts-when-dealing-with-an-auto-mechanic/https://www.rd.com/advice/saving-money/13-things-your-car-mechanic-wont-tell-you-slideshow/"

        "description": "",
        "content": "We commonly associate the word ‘mother’ with a woman who has given birth to and/or raised a child from birth. However, some children have biological mothers, others have adopted, step or foster mothers. Some mothers take care of everyone around them, but have no children of their own. Some people are lucky enough to have mothers-in-law who treat them as their own. We also get women who proudly refer to themselves as dog moms, and rightfully so because being a pet owner is an incredibly important job. Whilst each mother has a different parenting style, we know that they all possess some similar qualities. Mothers truly know the meaning of the word unconditional. A mother will always look at those she loves and see their best qualities, and she will strive to bring out the best in everyone around her. Her loved ones can always count on her to pick them up when they fall, and to celebrate with them when they succeed. A mother always has her loved ones best interest at the centre of her heart, and she is always ready to offer a helping hand.Read more about some of the many mothers we are celebrating this month:1. The home away from home momFor 17 years, Monica has been the matron at a boys’ high school. Because she primarily functions as a caregiver to the boys while they are at school, she sees herself as their favourite aunt. While many people believe that taking care of boys is a tough job, Monica sees it as an honour to witness the kids mature from teenagers in grade 8 to confident, respectful young men in matric. She practices yoga every morning before ‘rising bell’ so she is composed and ready for any eventuality that the day might bring.2. The mom who puts her daughter firstThis young mom of one truly encapsulates what it means to be a present mother. Having a 7 year-old daughter is no walk in the park, but this Media Custodian makes it look so worthwhile. What keeps her going is knowing that there is an actual person who relies on her to groom her into a future leader, and what an incredible job she is doing so far. Puseletso teaches her daughter to start off each morning with a prayer and a motivational reminder of how great she is, just in case she forgets.3. The mi casa es su casa momEureka has run Bobbi Bear, an emergency home that houses children who have been abused, for an incredible 18 years. In those many years, she has seen how vital it is to assist the child within 72 hours to prevent HIV. Having 22 aiders by her side enables her to protect and support every child who comes into her care. The children know there is always someone to listen, no matter what they have to share. Many come back with wonderful news later in life, such as news of their engagement or graduation, and this is what makes it so worth it for Eureka and her team.4. The mom with endless loveSix years ago, Christine’s niece came to live with her, and just a year later, she welcomed three more adopted kids into her warm home. A rather huge adjustment for this Group Communications Consultant, but her own mother’s support helped her adapt to her new role in life as the mother of four. Today, she is strengthened by seeing the smiles on her kids’ faces each day, and the night time hugs and kisses make life worth living. The one thing Christine ensures happens in her home is saying ‘I love you’ to each other even while fighting because no one knows what each day brings. A great lesson for all of us, indeed.These are just four of the many mothers that we at 1st for Women are celebrating, not just this mother’s day but all year round. We thank you all for everything that you have done, everything that you do and everything that you will continue doing. "

        "content": " If you’re on a well-deserved beach break, we know you’ll want to make sure you and your loved ones make the most of your leisure time. That’s why we’ve put together these 10 easy tips to stay safe at the beach, so you can get the relaxation you deserve.1. Leave phones at home                                Rather leave your portable possessions, like your phone, at home for a few hours so you can relax without stressing about them. It’s better not to take your purse, either. Instead, take only the cash you need to buy your ice-cream and slap chips; if you lose it, it’s not a big deal.If you simply have to take your phone with to record your fun holiday memories, look at getting a waterproof pouch that’s designed for swimming.2. Know the safety basicsA little bit of knowledge goes a long way when it comes to beach safety. First, look out for shark-warning flags. The basics are: green is safe, black is OK, white is that a shark has been spotted so stay out of the water, and red means serious hazards in the water.It’s also important to stay between the flags when you’re swimming so the lifeguards can keep an eye on you. Also, areas outside the flags may contain dangerous rip currents.3. Rip current rescueIf you are caught in a rip current, the most important thing to do is remain calm. Swimming against it and towards shore will tire you out. Rather, float and wave and call for help, or swim parallel to the shore until you escape the rip current. Then, you can swim at an angle towards the shore.4. Spotting someone in danger       Contrary to popular belief, it can be quite difficult to spot someone struggling in water as it happens quickly and quietly. This is one of the reasons why it’s so important to remain calm and signal for help if you find yourself in this position.If you see someone treading furiously, making no sounds, with their head tilted back, and grabbing for something beneath the waves, call a lifeguard immediately; they could be in trouble.5. Sandcastle fun Spending time at the beach with the little ones creates such wonderful memories for them. Building sandcastles is great fun for the kids, but be sure to supervise them when they’re digging up sand; shards of glass and other random debris can hurt them.6. Say no to sunburnIt’s not fun when sunburn holds you back from doing what you want on holiday. Play it safe and apply sunscreen half an hour before you’ll be in the sun, even when it’s overcast, and reapply it at least every two hours. And, don’t forget to apply under your cozzie so you don’t get any sneaky, surprise burns!7. Under your umbrellaSpeaking of keeping safe from the sun, an umbrella will offer the best protection. UVA damage is unseen so, even if you’re not burning, you could still be damaging your skin. Without shade, you also run the risk of getting sunstroke, which is serious.8. Stay hydratedIt’s easy to forget to get your six to eight glasses of water on a normal day, but because you’re spending time in the sun, it’s even more important to stay hydrated. Pack a few litres of water or make sure to buy when you’re at the beach.9. Parking proParking bays at the beach fill up quickly. Try get there early so you can get a secure parking near the entrance, and you’ll get a prime spot on the beach, too! If you need to park further away, make sure it’s not in a secluded area – look out for areas where other people are parking, too.It’s also a good idea to place any valuables you leave in your car out of sight. Criminals will be less likely to go for a car where there is nothing visible to tempt them.10. Take a buddyThe buddy system is one of the best ways to keep safe at the beach, especially for kids. It’s a lot safer – and more fun – to have someone you can watch out for, and who watches out for you, whether you’re swimming, walking along the sand, or grabbing a bite to eat.                                                                                                                                If you’d like more tips and ideas on how to look after yourself and your loved ones these holidays, read our holiday safety tips blog. And remember, if you need emergency home or roadside assistance during the holidays, our 1st for Women Guardian Angels are ready to assist you.References: https://www.westerncape.gov.za/general-publication/how-stay-safe-beach-summer; https://www.livingandloving.co.za/child/7-must-know-beach-safety-facts; http://www.plett-tourism.co.za/know-your-shark-warning-flags/; https://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen/sunscreens-explained"

        "heading": "10 tips for an awesome Easter road trip",
        "description": "",
        "content": "Whether you’re planning an epic trip with the girls, a family vaycay or a couple’s retreat, road trips are a fantastic way to spend time with those you love while enjoying all of our country’s magnificent scenery.With all the adventure that awaits, you don’t want over-planning and a rigid schedule to spoil the spontaneity but a rough plan and a few key preparations will help keep you relaxed and on track as you head off into the sunrise.1. Make sure your car is worthy of the roadBefore any long trip, a thorough check that your car’s in good working order, is always in order – not only for your safety and that of your passengers but for other road users too. Also check that your spare tyre’s in good nick, your petrol tank is full and you have enough oil and water. If you have a little spare time before your trip, why not brush up on tyre changing skills.2. Jam pack with snacksStaying energised and hydrated on the road will keep you mentally alert and physically on form. Just make sure you have plenty stops planned along the way for bathroom and stretch breaks. Stack up a cooler bag with food that’s easy to eat and healthy. Think nuts, biltong, fruit and pretzels and of course, plenty water. Pack an extra few plastic bags for rubbish to keep the car clean and uncluttered. You can of course pick up food at your pit stops so don’t keep things that will spoil easily or get squished along the way!3. Avoid no phone phobiaCharging cables and battery packs are essential. Test these before you leave especially if you haven’t used them in a while. This is not so you can scroll through Instagram and Facebook for hours instead of enjoying all the wonderful sights and connecting with your travel companions, but rather so you can connect with the outside world in case of an emergency. Keep Guardian Angel on Call on standby. It’s the in-app crash detector that sends emergency help to your phone\"s location in case you\"re in an accident. Ts&amp;Cs apply.4. Game changerThere’s far more to road trip games then I Spy that can keep you occupied for hours. How about “At the Movies”. It’s really easy. One person starts and names an actor or actress, the next person needs to name a movie they starred in, then the next person needs to name another actor/actress from the same movie and so it continues. If someone gets the answer wrong, they don’t get to participate in the next round. Put a time limit on answers to see who cracks under the pressure! Check out more quirky game ideas here. If you’re travelling with young kids, engaging games like “I’m going on a picnic…” or 20 questions are great options. 5. On-point podcastsGet your travel companions to each pick a topic they’re interested in and download a podcast on it. This is a great way to understand and appreciate each other’s interests and will help spark conversation and debate. The best podcasts of 2017 will keep you entertained for hours.6. Locals know what’s lekkerNot sure where to find the best eats around, along the road, ask the locals. We have become so dependent on technology, blogs and websites that we forget that people often have the most wonderful and rich answers. Wherever you do stop along the way, take in your surroundings to make sure you’re in a safe area.  7. First aid kitA headache or stomach cramps can really make a long trip unpleasant so a well-stocked first aid kit is always a good idea.8. Go old school with pen and paperWhile your GPS is probably your best navigation guide, keep a map book on hand or print out a giant map and plot your route. This is a good way to keep the kids involved and interested, allowing them to see how far you’ve gone and where your next stop is. It’s also a great keepsake and one which you can hang up at home after your trip. Jotting down memories and adding photos will make for an interesting and eye-catching feature.9. Pre-road trip security and insurance checkThe last thing you want is to worry about the safety of your home and what’s inside while you’re away. So make sure all your insurance is up-to-date before you leave – including your car, home, buildings and portable possessions cover.10. Have a blast!Remember why you planned a road trip in the first places – whether it’s to reconnect with your friends, spend time with your family or enjoy a romantic adventure, don’t let the little irritations on the road, like rude drivers or traffic jams, ruin the mood. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!And finally, remember that 1st for Women is with you every step and km of the way, so you’re always ready, just in case."

        "content": "As we near the end of the year, many women are already thinking ahead to 2018 and what the New Year may hold in store for them. As females, we tend to carry an invisible load on our shoulders at all times – trying to balance the act of being responsible for our homes, families, careers, finances and social circles. At times, it may seem insurmountable, but day in and day out, not only do we manage, we excel.1. Professional female athletics are on the rise19 years old Erin Gallagher is making headlines as one of the fastest swimmers on the African continent. 26 year old Mariske Strauss was the top South African female cyclist finisher at the 2017 Absa Cape Epic. These ladies are just two examples of how South African athletes are making their mark in the world of sport.2. We make great leaders in scienceAt the age of 29, Mthatha-born Dr Ncumisa Jilata has become Africa’s youngest neurosurgeon following her Fellowship graduation in Durban on 18 May 2017. Dr S’thembile Ngidi made history at the age of 31 when she graduated from the Colleges of Medicine South Africa as KwaZulu-Natal’s first ever Black female oncologist – and only the country’s second. That’s two more great examples of women being great leaders.3. The most badass characters on TV right now are womenAlmost everywhere you look on local TV nowadays, there’s an incredible woman saving the day. The world is finally seeing a more realistic portrayal of women in TV shows and movies.  4. We’re responsible for some of the most important inventions of our timeBorn in Rustenburg, Thato Kgathlanye is the creator of Repurpose Schoolbags, a green innovation made from recycled plastic bags which integrates solar technology so that children may study for up to 12 hours.These are just a few examples why we know that there has never been a better time to be a woman, and why we have so much to look forward to in 2018.And isn’t it reassuring to know that throughout 2018, you’ll have a wingwoman whose priority is women, keeping them safe and making their life easier.  At 1st for Women, we’ve got a Guardian Angel on Call who will send emergency medical assistance if you’re in a severe car accident when you have comprehensive car or comprehensive off-road vehicle insurance. You also have Guardian Angels to assist you with road, home and medical emergencies; and together with us, you help us fight women abuse on behalf of the women of South Africa as a portion of all our customers’ premiums are donated to our Foundation.Here’s to an amazing 2018 with you.

        "content": "The multi-dimensional requirements of modern society means the pressure is real for women, who it is estimated drive 70-80% of household purchasing decisions, while juggling family, friends, jobs and careers; which is why women like to be prepared for those ‘just in case’ scenarios to deliver on the demands of their busy world.Women’s innate ability to be prepared for whatever may happen is not conjecture – it’s scientific fact – women’s brains are structurally designed for interconnectivity, making them effective at multi-skilling, as well as considering multiple eventualities.Take holidays, for example, research indicates that women pack more than they need when going on holiday. In fact, research found that women over-pack by two thirds when they go away, with 79% citing the most common reason for this being ‘just in case’.As women, we carry almost everything we could ever possibly need with us, just in case.  We often think about leaving 15 minutes early, just in case there’s traffic. Truth is, we like to be prepared for any possible situation – and we are wired to do so. Our minds are creating never-ending mental lists to make sure we keep as many bases covered as possible.That’s why we keep a screwdriver in the car, or super glue in our handbags. That’s why we research things before we do them. We have a plan for just about everything. It makes us feel secure. It makes us feel confident that we can do almost anything because we’ve prepared for it.As a modern woman you may often need to multi-task in order to perform at your peak and sometimes just get what needs to be done done, at work, at home and at play. And you manage all of this because you are adept at delivering all that your world requires of you because you are prepared.Celebrating Women’s MonthWe have been celebrating these amazing women during Women’s Month with the launch of our ‘Always ready. Just in case’ television commercial, aimed at inspiring confidence in women by highlighting and celebrating the fact that being prepared is a strength of women, which assists them in being the best version of themselves – on their terms.  The advert is a metaphor for the very role insurance plays – being prepared in case something happens. 1st for Women is there for all those ‘just in case’ moments with insurance specifically designed for women – not only providing car and home insurance, but also supporting the unique needs of women by providing peace of mind and convenience through its Guardian Angel Assist service.Watch the advert here: https://youtu.be/eJ-eOrvjuGcJoin the conversation on Twitter: @firstforwomen, Instagram and Facebook: @1stforwomen at #JustInCase"

        "content": "Weather forecasters are urging residents of the Western and Northern Cape to be prepared for freezing temperatures, heavy rains, snow, and gale-force winds. 1st for Women wants to help you protect yourself, your loved ones, and your valued possessions from these severe weather conditions, so we have put together a few tips: HAIL AND SNOW If you’re in an area prone to severe frost or snow, ensure that the structures around your home can handle the extra weight and that you are equipped to clear any build-ups if necessary. Try to reinforce structures where needed.When hail and snow are forecasts, try to make arrangements to park your car undercover and delay travelling until the storm has subsided.If you’re caught in a storm while driving, look for cover. This could be a covered car park, a petrol station, or under a bridge. However, please take care when pulling-over; calmly put on your hazard lights and search for cover, so you and your loved ones are not at further risk.Don’t park under trees as there is a danger of falling branches and debris. Stay in your car and only leave the safety of your sheltered spot when the storm has passed.If there is no shelter nearby, rather pull over to the side of the road if it is safe to do so. In an unsheltered spot, hail damage is inevitable, but it’s safer to avoid driving through a storm when visibility is poor, the roads are slick, and there is a risk of aquaplaning through deep pools of water and ice. To protect your vehicle, keep heavy blankets in your car.  This will provide you with a protective covering you can throw over the bonnet to prevent hail damage.  FLOODS If you live in a flood-prone area, it’s a good idea to purchase your own supply of sandbags which can be placed against doorways and low-level vents in times of flooding. This will help minimise the amount of water that enters your home.  Also, move high-value items to the highest possible floor or shelf if a flood threatens.General and regular home maintenance, like clearing debris from gutters, is essential and will limit damage and discomfort in times of disaster.Turn off gas and electricity if flooding occurs.Try to avoid driving in flood conditions. Remember that just 15cm of moving water can knock you off your feet and water just 60cm deep can sweep a vehicle away. Generally, if the water is deeper than the bottom of your doors or the bottom third of your wheels, it’s not advisable to drive through it.Flash-flooding often occurs when rivers flow over low-lying bridges. Avoid crossing bridges or roads next to rivers during heavy rains. If you do get stuck on a flooded road, switch to the lowest possible gear and proceed slowly. If you approach a flooding stormwater drain at speed, take your foot off the accelerator and let your speed drop gradually. Don’t brake suddenly as this may cause the car to skid or aquaplane.If you become trapped in a vehicle during flooding, rather abandon the vehicle and climb to higher ground. It is dangerous to try to drive out of the water to safety. SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS, WIND, AND LIGHTNING Make sure that any dead and rotting branches are removed from trees to avoid the risk of falling debris during a severe storm. Also, ensure that debris is removed from roofs and gutters.Ensure that your outdoor furniture is safely stored or firmly secured.The power surge of a lightning strike can easily overload most appliances and devices, so it’s best to unplug these before the storm starts.If you’re driving and visibility is too poor or the road is too slippery, rather pull over and switch on your car’s hazards until visibility and traction improve. To stay safe, we urge you to keep up to date with the latest weather forecasts and keep the above tips in mind, so you can keep yourself and your loved ones safe.If you need to make a car or home insurance claim, you can contact us on 0861 11 18 05.

        "heading": "What makes you, you?",
        "description": "",
        "content": "Coffee. Clothes. Shoes. Body. Career. When asked ‘what makes you unique?. Most women recite a list of qualities that frame how they see themselves. But given the time to delve deeper into how they perceive their strengths, you’ll discover the complex realities of inspirational women. As part of our mission to see through their lens, 1st for Women Insurance asked four real South African women to honestly describe what makes them who they are.Instinctual individuality“It’s my unwavering commitment to the people around me – my friends, partner, family and colleagues. Knowingly making a commitment to be vulnerable and open when they need me,” describes Thandiswa, who works in media. She has a tight-knit circle of girlfriends and a long-term boyfriend – all of whom turn to her in a crisis.“Growing into who I am today meant learning to trust my instincts – to know when my gut is telling me something, to work out why and follow it. I see this as an intrinsically female quality. It also means wearing my heart not just on my sleeve but right on my collar.”There are also insecurities that come with being the woman she is, says Thandiswa. And she’s on the journey to accept they don’t mean weakness. They’re a part of her makeup she has to gracefully embrace if she wants to grow her confidence and achieve her many incredible dreams.“I’ve had heartbreak. A lot of it. But part of who I am is forgiving and giving love a second, third and fourth chance, if necessary. Because that’s just the kind of woman I am.”Putting the rest firstFor others, it’s tapping into the needs of the group. Erika, who works in IT, identifies her own sensitivity as her defining characteristic. Although this sensitivity also gives way to insecurities, it’s also her single biggest strength.“Adopting the principle of ‘samewerking’ or working together is something I see as innately ‘me’ – I couldn’t get rid of it, even if I wanted to. It allows me to react with empathy, ahead of any other emotion. That’s the gift I’ve been given.”Once appreciated as gentle and ‘soft’, intrinsically female qualities are understood for the strength they hold and insights they bring, both within the workplace and without. This, along with the rise of women unafraid to assert their characteristics as not always conforming to the traditional notion of what it means to be a woman.Decisions and declarations“For me, it’s out-and-out, unapologetic confidence,” declares Nicky, a PR specialist. Working in a predominantly female environment, she sees the strength of the different kinds of inspirational women around her on a daily basis.“I value my ability to be decisive because it’s a rare quality, no matter your gender. I’m also constantly amazed at how, no matter what the day brings, the women around me seem to bounce back with bravery to the next challenge.If there’s one thing Vicky knows above all else, it’s the reluctance with which the women around her celebrate – or don’t celebrate – the characteristics that make them who they are.Labels to love“We’re so hung up on labels. Labels on the things we wear, the labels of the things we do. We’re told, constantly, that labels are negative. But what about the labels we can and should declare? The labels that boldly say, ‘I’m the only version of myself’. We aren’t conditioned to celebrate these qualities and wear them where the world can see them,” observes Nicky.“Too often we fade into a sea of what’s supposed to be feminine, without acknowledging that our gender doesn’t make us one way or another. It gives us shared characteristics and experiences. But it’s just the springboard for a whole new level of greatness, measured not against the women around us, but by ourselves.”At 1st for Women, we know being a woman is both the greatest thing about you, and just the beginning of who you are. By continuously affirming individuality and giving words of encouragement, 1st for Women Insurance hopes to support and inspire women on their journey to confidence.Start today and start small. Whether it’s a list of affirmations or a conversation with a woman in your life to start talking about their challenges with acceptance. It starts with recognising qualities in ourselves and each other, and coming to terms with the many different kinds of strength and individuality. In turn, being inspired not only by ourselves but by incredible and inspirational women around us.1st for Women Insurance knows you do so much for so many and seldom put yourself first. That’s a quality most women share. But what else defines you as the woman you are today? Share your truths and you could win a professional photoshoot to the value of R15 000.

Think champagne, scrumptious treats, well-deserved pampering and so much more!All five hundred guests had the chance to take in truly breathtaking views and enjoy a lavish buffet, while being entertained by one of Cape Town’s favourite performers, Emo Adams. And it really was the perfect way to celebrate some of the most amazing women in our lives – and put them first in a very special way!Here’s what two attendees had to say:“Thank -you so much for selecting me for this special occasion I was absolutely blown away by the event!We arrived early and already it was buzzing with ladies. We were greeted by the 1st for Woman angels and that was fabulous, later we had a photograph taken with them. Careful thought and planning went into every detail to make this a special day. Loads of champagne throughout the event (and us ladies do love our bubbles!). This truly is a beautiful venue. We also thoroughly enjoyed Emo Adams and laughed so much, while Smile Radio had us going with entertaining quizzes.The 1st for Women Ambassador and the team were fabulous and made us feel like queens. Thank you so much for the extra gifts we received, we were so spoilt. 1st for Woman rocks! I hope I get chosen again one day!Thank you so much!

        "content": "Messages to your motherReal women on the big, beautiful cycle of motherhoodOf all the women in your life, how often do you affirm your mother? Or yourself, simply for being one? Women do so much for so many, and seldom put themselves first – particularly when recognising the incredible qualities they silently instil in their children. And the many powerful and inspirational ways they put their children first.On our mission to understand the realities of South African women, 1st for Women insurance asked real mothers how they tackle the challenges and triumphs of motherhood – to better tailor-make home insurance, life insurance and car insurance for the women who want to protect what’s precious. A life of care and compromise “I never realised my daughter would be the greatest friend I’d ever have. The truth is: before I became a mother, I was lonely,” says Portia, secretary and mother of Bokamoso, who is three years old. “Now the most pivotal goal in my life is to keep her safe and happy. I’ve never known that kind of dedication.”Portia’s role as a mother means grappling with real challenges too. Challenges that come as a result of constantly putting her daughter first.“I have to wake Bokamoso up at four in the morning, to travel and get her to crèche on time. When she’s deep in sleep, waking her is the hardest thing I have to do. But I know getting her to a safe place while I’m at work benefits her in the long run.”The best part of Portia’s day is watching Bokamoso’s face light up when she fetches her from school, after being away from her for almost twelve hours. And Portia is determined to give her daughter the opportunities she never had. She’s driven to ensure her daughter is well-educated and has an open line of communication between the two of them – something Portia herself never had.“All I can hope for is that she’s gentle, sensitive and wise. Even at three, I can see she’s strong and disciplined. How much of that comes from me? I don’t often think about it, but I suppose it has to come from me.” Years of youthThe challenges of being a mother shapeshift as children grow through the many stages of life. Stefnie, a paralegal in her fifties, says the magical – sometimes unbelievable – thing about being a mother is watching a tiny body in a bundle of blankets develop into a real person. If you’re lucky, like Stefnie, a person of whom you can be proud.“I didn’t have a relationship with my mother the way I do with my daughter. She’s my best friend. Being a single mother wasn’t easy. Making sure she has everything she needs is hard work. It’s the call of duty for a mother – you put your children first, no matter what. And hardly ever take credit when you watch them bloom into strong and honest people.”Stefnie believes there’s no other way to be a mother. In her opinion, it’s part of the deal.“A child doesn’t choose to come into the world. It’s a decision made for them. It’s unfair not to give them the tools they need to go into the world with the right attitude.” Raising responsiblyDebbie, who’s in her forties, says she’s often surprised at the real and visible effect she has on the people her children are becoming. Knowing she’s raising a child who cares about animals and the environment fills her with pride. But she’s slow to take credit for it.“Environmental awareness and animal rights are a personal passion of mine. When my son, who’s ten, announced he was becoming a vegetarian, I almost fell of my chair. I didn’t think for a second that it was a reflection of my beliefs – I was just so proud of him. I suppose that’s the reality: as mothers, we pour our heart and soul into our children, trying our best to grow them into good people. And when it does happen, we can’t quite believe it’s because of us.”As Debbie puts it: there’s no such thing as being a perfect mother. You make the right decision with the information you have available, and then hope for the best. A strange and beautiful cycleBuhle, a developer in her twenties, is unfazed about working in a male-dominated environment like IT. Her success against the odds, has spurred her on to instil the belief in her daughter that she can do anything she puts her mind to.“Many South African women have no choice but to send their young daughters to live with their grandparents from a young age. I’m fortunate enough to be in the position to keep my daughter close to me – even if it makes life difficult at times. It means I can imprint my values and principles on her. Nurturing her into an intelligent and confident woman is the most important thing in life.”Compromise is a part of Buhle’s daily life. She finds herself unconsciously putting herself second, in everything she does, to give her daughter access to endless opportunities. And although her upbringing was vastly different to her daughter’s, she wishes she knew the enormity of being a mother earlier in life, so she could give her mother credit too.“I don’t readily give myself credit for being a mother. My mother didn’t give herself credit for being a mother. And likely, neither will my daughter. Being a mother is the most natural role in the world, albeit not the easiest. Yet it feels so unnatural to take credit for motherhood. It’s a strange and beautiful cycle. I just wish someone had stopped to ask me what I’d like to thank my mother for, when I was a girl. Because maybe she never knew just how strong she really was, even when she didn’t feel it.”What’s the one thing you wish your mother knew? Mothers do so much for so many and seldom put themselves first, which is why 1st for Women does. And why they’re calling on women to tell their mother the one thing they wish they knew.

        "content": "Four women on why they dim their shine“Shifting the focus is too tempting. It means avoiding acknowledging that who I am and what I’ve done, is enough.”Nonku is an independent 26-year old, working in the creative industry. She’s attractive, bubbly and talented. Her friends and colleagues adore her. She’s on her way up. Her biggest struggle? Finding the voice to recognise her unique qualities and characteristics. And helping her ‘tribe’ find theirs.Under-spoken under pressure“I’m surrounded by the most inspirational women – but so few of them give themselves credit or even realise how incredible they are. My colleagues hand their success to colleagues around them. My mother is a perfect example. She’s constantly deferring her own needs to take care of friends or family. She carries the heaviest loads and solves problems every day. But she just doesn’t see it. I wish she knew how incredible she is.”Nonku’s reality isn’t an exceptional one: she’s the voice of a generation of women who’ve realised just how seldom they celebrate themselves and each other. Recently graduated, Zooey, feels the constant fog of insecurity for many reasons. At twenty, she’s just moved in with her boyfriend after living with her mom.“There’s just so much doubt. It’s simpler to be altruistic and put others first, because it plays on our maternal instincts. I watched my mother single-handedly raise two children while starting from the bottom of a company and working her way up. And the only thing she can focus on is what she didn’t do – while I admire everything she’s done, in spite of her challenges. I wish she could see herself the way others see her.”Fear of the imposterLike Zooey, Nthabi, 37, believes the women around her often don’t own their strength and resolve because they don’t always feel strong. Nthabi lives alone and works as a social media community manager.“Imposter syndrome is real. So many women live in perpetual fear someone is going to discover they’re not good at anything – that their unique qualities amount to nothing at all. Which isn’t true. I see it in women all around me – no matter the support they’re getting. They’re consumed by an undercurrent of disbelief.”The tendency to put others before themselves is an admirable female quality, and speaks to the need for women to bolster the conversation for louder, prouder female voices who, if they can’t do it for themselves, give each other the recognition they richly deserve.Why seek permission?“If you have children, you realistically live with the struggle of balancing work and home. But if you elect not to have children? You’re expected to give more of yourself to work or to friends or family. Women still don’t put themselves first – which is all the more reason they need to be acknowledged for it.” says Helena, a 38-year old website developer.“We so often look for permission, not recognition. And even when we give ourselves permission to own our struggles, we take no credit for surmounting them. It’s essential we become advocates for each other’s achievements – while honouring the beautiful intrinsic qualities that come with being a woman.”So how to encourage women to assert their voices in the conversation more confidently? It starts with opening the door for recognition and appreciation. The goal posts may be intangible, but that doesn’t make it impossible.Authentic and honest conversation starts with recognising just how and why women don’t put themselves first. Why they’re often so wary to concede to the full extent of their strength and resolve – and encouraging them to feel confident, even when they don’t feel strong. And, taking this reality into account, fostering safe spaces for women to meaningfully celebrate each other – both publicly and privately. Telling them, for all the world to see, just how inspirational they are to the women around them. Even when they don’t feel it themselves.Helena states the challenge candidly, pointedly identifying that it’s not about changing or removing the tendency to put others first, but giving equal time and energy to recognition too.“The ability of women to both subconsciously and intentionally put others before themselves gives us a unique power of our own. It means deeper relationships built on mutual trust. But that doesn’t mean we don’t need the affirmation too. Or that we shouldn’t be encouraged to step out of our comfort zones from time to time and really put ourselves and each other in the limelight. To honestly and authentically declare: you’re enough. I’m enough. We’re enough.”"

        "content": "No-one really enjoys that awkward conversation that happens with the boss around salary increase time. But 2017 is the year to stand firm and ask for what you’re really worth. It’s time to close that gender pay gap – and these tips can help you make a pretty good start on negotiating that raise!Ask at the right timeIf your company’s finances aren’t in a good place, or your boss is too busy to really consider your request for a raise, hold off until the time is right. Consider asking after a positive windfall, like after winning a new client or account, or after you’ve accomplished an important task.Compare your salaryIf you think you’re being underpaid, or that you deserve more money for the work you’re doing, take a little time to investigate the average salary for the type of work you do. That should give you a better idea of how much more money you should be asking for – and it will also give you a little extra leverage. Just remember to take all the factors into account, such as how long you’ve been doing your job, where you’re located and how big your company is.Back it upYou know you’re worth more money, but it’s always a good idea to be able to show your boss why that’s the case. Make a note of everything you’ve achieved while you’ve been doing your job – all the highs, the great feedback, the small successes. With that kind of information, right there in black and white, your boss will get a clear reminder of what a great asset you are to the company.Consider cash-free benefitsSometimes your company might just not be in a place where they can offer you more money. So, in a situation like that, consider asking for some other kinds of rewards or benefits, like a promotion, more flexible working hours, or extra time off instead.Just remember though, what matters most is that when it comes to the salary you deserve, make sure you know your value and stand up for yourself. You need to ask for what you want and, the fact is, by being just a little braver, you’re much more likely to get it."

        "content": "This month, we’re drawing inspiration from this this beautiful quote from Lao Tzu: “Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.” Relationships play such an important role in our lives, and they’re hard to ignore – especially on Valentine’s Day.A heart’s desiresOur interactions with other people are vital components to our health and wellbeing. But why have so many people latched onto the idea of this day? Most people believe it’s because everybody has a desire to give and receive love. And, on this day, we are paid extra special attention.Where it all startedIf you know a thing or two about the history of Valentine’s Day, you’ll know it has nothing to do with the modern-day event it has become. V-Day is named after Saint Valentine, a Catholic priest who lived in Rome in the third century. He was executed on 14 February for marrying soldiers in secret, during a time when this was forbidden in Rome.Over the years, different cultures have developed their own traditions for Valentine’s Day. In some parts of the world, it’s observed as a day for expressing love between family members and friends, rather than that of romantic couples. We’ve rounded up some international traditions to show you how you can care for your relationships and express your love.FriendshipsYou can make Valentine’s Day special for a friend by spoiling them with an unexpected gift, or through an act of service. In Finland &amp; Estonia, 14 February does not revolve around romantic relationships as much as it does around friendships. The day is known locally as “Friend’s Day”, and people give each other gifts to celebrate this bond.Lovely idea: Offer to take your best friend’s kids to the movies while she enjoys some well-deserved time off from her busy schedule.  Romantic relationshipsYou don’t have to spend a lot of money to express your love to your partner. In Denmark, lovers send “anonymous” love notes (rhymes) to one another. If you guess the name of the person who sent the note, you are rewarded with an Easter egg later in the year. It is also a custom to send pressed white flowers, called Snowdrops.Lovely idea: On a nice piece of paper, write a love letter to your special someone. Put some flower petals inside the letter when folding it. Then, put it in an envelope and seal with a kiss.Relationships with familyDo your family members know how much they mean to you? Tell them with a simple, sweet gesture. In Ghana, 14 February is also National Chocolate Day.Lovely idea: Invite the family over for a sweet celebration of love this Valentine’s Day. Serve drinks and treats, and then send everyone home with a small chocolate favour.It starts with youA relationship with yourself is equally as important as your friendships, romantic relationships, and your family.

        "content": "South Africa has a rich selection of female writers who are busy making waves in the international world of fiction.  If you haven’t read some of these talented women’s novels, now is the time to start… Covering everything from grisly otherworldly murders, tautly written psychological pieces, gender and political explorations to coming of age stories of an African childhood, these gripping reads will be an inspiring addition to any bookshelf or book club.Lauren Beukes: Arguably the most well-recognised SA female author, Lauren’s half-fantasy, thrilling novels include The Shining Girls, Broken Monsters and Zoo City and have been translated into more than 23 languages for readers across the world.  From a time-travelling serial killer to a dystopian Johannesburg and a young woman with a sloth on her back, Lauren Beukes’ writing is well-researched, imaginative and deeply engrossing.Miriam Tlali:  The first black woman ever to publish a novel in South Africa, Miriam Tlali’s Muriel at Metropolitan was published in 1975 in South Africa, and later translated in several different languages.  Both this and her next novel, Amandla were banned by the apartheid government. A truly inspirational writer, Miriam Tlali founded the publishing house Skotaville and as a member of the Women\"s National Coalition, she assisted in drafting the Preamble to the South African Women\"s Charter.Rachel Zadok: Rachel’s first novel, Gem Squash Tokoloshe, was published to great acclaim in South Africa and abroad and was subsequently shortlisted for The Whitbread First Novel Award (2005) and The John Llewellyn Rhys Prize (2005). The book provides an entertaining and sometimes disturbing glimpse in to a childhood spent in Africa. Her latest novel, Sister Sister, was published by Kwela Books, and nominated for the Herman Charles Bosman Prize; the UJ Prize and the Sunday Times Fiction Award.Nadia Davids:  Although she’s just published her first novel An Imperfect Blessing, Nadia Davids is a well-known playwright whose writing has garnered various theatre awards and nominations and been staged internationally (in Africa, Europe and The United States). Set in Cape Town, An Imperfect Blessing “places one family’s story at the heart of a country’s rebirth and asks big questions about faith, race, belonging and freedom.”1 Henrietta Rose-Innes: JM Coetzee said of her work: “Henrietta Rose-Innes writes an admirably taut, clean prose … a welcome addition to the new South African literature.”  Ninevahm which deals with an insect infestation at a planned luxury resort, was published in the UK and US in 2016, and translated into Spanish and French and was shortlisted for the South African Sunday Times Fiction Prize and the M-Net Literary Award. Henrietta’s latest novel The Green Lion centres on the escape of the last black-maned lion and ‘explores the animal instinct in human nature, the battle between chaos and order and the effects of the past on the present with writing so powerful it informs all your senses”.2Margie Orford: If you’re a lover of crime fiction, look no further than Margie Orford’s well-written and plotted page turners. Her main character, Dr Clare Hart, is a police profiler, filmmaker and journalist, working the streets of a Cape Town riddled with corruption, ravaged by violence and frequently buffeted by a screaming South Easter.  Currently there are five Clare Hart novels, so begin with number one, Like Clockwork and you’ll still have four more to enjoy: Blood Rose,  Gallows Hill, Daddy\"s Girl and Water MusicZoe Wicomb:  Zoe Wicomb’s first full-length novel David’s Story, is set partly in 1991, toward the close of the apartheid era and explores “the role of coloureds and women in the military wing of the ANC, and the challenges of adjustment to the realities of the New South Africa\". 3 Playing in the Light, her second novel tells the story of the daughter of a coloured couple who have passed for white all their lives. As Marion finds out more about her parents and the past, she begins a journey that reveals the truth about herself and post-apartheid South Africa. Her latest novel October, published in 2015, is set between Scotland and South Africa and asks its characters searching questions about the nature of ‘home’.Sally Andrew: If you haven’t met Tannie Maria yet, now is the time to buy Tannie Maria’s Recipes for Love and Murder and introduce yourself. Set in a small town in the Karoo, this easy-to-read mystery is shot through with Tannie Maria’s amazing love of cooking (and eating!) as she tracks down a killer and dispenses advice (and recipes) through her weekly column in the local paper. Sally Andrew has recently written a sequel, Tannie Maria and the Satanic Mechanic, and both are delightful, intriguing feel-good reads.Cynthia Jele: Fans of chick-lit will love Happiness is a Four-Letter Word, Cynthia Jele’s fizzy tale of four friends set in Jozi, dealing with love, life and loss. Zaza, spoiled and married with children is having an affair and waiting for her world to crash in around her ears; Nandi’s wedding is moments away and she’s having doubts; Tumi’s always wanted a child, but not one her husband fathered with someone else; and Princess, the ardent feminist is finally, unwisely, in love. These four feisty women will be your BFFs in this Sex-And-the-City meets Sandton romance.Now that you have some home-grown South African women authors to look forward to reading, why squeeze a few more books into your ‘me-time’?  Or bring your book club up to speed with what’s happening on the local literature front?  Either way, we’re sure you’ll find some inspiring words among the pages and we wish you many happy hours of reading in 2017.  1 http://www.nadiadavids.com/an-imperfect-blessing/2.

        "content": "At 1st for Women, we want 2017 to be the year where you are at your best. Because you do so much for so many and seldom put yourself first, we do. So here are 7 key areas to focus on now so that you have your best year yet.The importance of relationshipsFor many of women, our relationships are a major, important and integral part of our lives. Healthy relationships are a crucial part of wellbeing and prosperity. There is compelling proof that having good, solid relationships with those we love contributes to a long and happy life. Relationships enhance our life experience exponentially, particularly the relationships we have with those closest to us. This year, we encourage you to nurture and protect those that mean the most to you.Keep busyness at bayWomen juggle so many roles on a daily basis, and this can take a toll on us physically, mentally and emotionally. If you feel you are too busy that you’re convinced you can’t manage to have a few hours for yourself, then it’s crucial that you create some “me time”. However busy you are, you can find time for yourself – even if you have to start with just a few minutes each day that might mean: Jogging for 30 minutes a few times a week to reenergise your body; reading a book during your lunch hour to ‘switch your mind off’ from work; or meditating once a day to revive your soul.Exercise regularlyWhen we are physically active, the body produces endorphins which keep us healthy and happy. Even the smallest amount of exercise regularly can lead to amazing results. The health benefits of regular exercise and physical activity are hard to ignore. Need an emotional lift? Or need to blow off some steam after a stressful day? A gym session or brisk 30-minute walk can help. Everyone benefits from exercise, regardless of age, sex or physical ability.Have some funWhen you’re stressed, your immune system weakens and this increases your chances of getting sick. Having fun provides you with an opportunity for holistic development while helping you manage your stress. De-stressing by playing some games with your loved ones or watching a comedy show with friends can energise you and build your strength and self-esteem. It is good for you, so why not have more of it this year?You are enoughLearn to trust yourself and to know that you are enough for what you want in your life. The feeling of not being good enough can lead to you getting in your own way. You don’t have to be more, do more, or buy more to be who you are meant to be. You are enough as you are, and that means you can grow and change and continue to become, because you aren’t trying to prove yourself to anyone.Be YouThe next time you feel like it may be too late to make your dreams come true, remember that you only have one life, and it is never too late to be who you want to be and live the life that you\"re meant to live. So what is holding you back? You have this inherent strength, resolve and power to do this. Recognise your value and then put steps in place no matter how small they may be so that the little wins turn into life changing results.Don’t be afraid to dream bigWe are often afraid to dream big for fear of being disappointed. Be open to life’s incredible possibilities and know that even if you face perceived failure, you will still benefit from having tried your best. Don’t be afraid to dig deep and find those dreams that you’ve buried because you didn’t think they could happen. At 1st for Women, we believe in putting you first so that you have more time to do the things that make you happy and spend time being the best you possible. We hope these tips will help you make this year your best year yet. Whatever your heart’s desires are, know and trust that anything is possible because of your inner strength and resolve as a woman.Source:http://www.bodybuilding.com/content/61-fitness-tips-to-make-2016-your-year-of-change.htmlhttps://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/why-you-should-take-more-time-for-yourself/http://tinybuddha.com/blog/changing-direction-its-not-too-late-to-be-who-you-want-to-be/"

        "description": "",
        "content": "Read this article and you’ll never need to worry about getting a flat again!  And hopefully, you’ll be able to do the job with nails intact and not a mark on your LBD, which just makes everything way more impressive.  Of course, as a 1st for Women policyholder your policy includes the Guardian Angels Lifestyle Assist benefits which include the Road Assist benefit – and should you ever suffer a flat battery, tyre or any other kind of breakdown, we’ll come to your aid immediately! So, while you may not ever need the advice below – it’s useful to know, and please feel free to print it out and give it to a friend who isn’t insured through 1st for Women Part 1 – getting started. If you’ve already tried calling everyone you know for help and no-ones answering, prepare yourself.  Repeat after me “I can change this tyre myself”.  A couple of deep breaths should help too. Now let’s get going:Make sure you’re somewhere safe before you stop. Look for a well-lit area, out of the way of traffic.Start on a flat surface – changing a tyre won’t work on a hill or incline, because you don’t want your car rolling away. Make sure your handbrake is on, and the car is not in gear.Remove the spare, (usually in your boot) and roll it to where you need it to be.Take off the hub cap or wheel cover – a screwdriver inserted into the side where the cap meets the wheel and jiggled about should pop it off. (Think of it as taking the lid off a tin of paint – but with a little more elbow grease needed.)Find your wrench, and use it to loosen the wheel nuts. The wrench should fit snugly over each nut and you just need to put some weight behind it to get them to move and turn (sometimes using a foot and stepping on the wrench with force can help – remove expensive heels first). Don’t take the nuts completely off – you’ll only remove them later when you’ve jacked up your car.  Part 2 – the hard(er) bit This may take a little effort - but as a woman, you do much tougher things than this every day! Promise yourself a reward afterward, and get going. Place the jack securely under the edge of the car – your car manual should show you exactly where to place it.  Then pump the handle up and down until the car is around 15 cm off the ground and the flat tyre is not touching the ground at all.Take off the loosened wheel nuts by hand and pull the tyre towards you.Put the spare tyre on to the bolts where the wheel nuts were. Once the tyre is in place, but the wheel nuts back on and tighten them by hand and with your wrench. They don’t have to be perfect right now - you’ll tighten them again when the car is on the ground. Part 3 – the end You’re on the downhill now, take heart – it’s almost over!  Not only will you be on the road again soon, but you’ll be able to impress everyone you know with your general awesomeness.Pump the jack down to put your car on the ground, and then use your wrench again to tighten the wheel nuts as much as you can.If you’re feeling confident replace the hub cap yourself – by whacking it back in (a shoe works well here), or wait until you find a service station that can do it for you – it’s not essential to the functioning of your car.AddThis Sharing ButtonsAlternatively, simply call 0860 10 42 12 and 1st for Women will despatch help to you right away – and one of our Guardian Angels in their (very) pink BMWs will be with you as soon as possible to get you safely on your way!"

        "content": "Estée Lauder once said, “I never dreamed of success, I worked for it.’’ And in 2016 that’s an approach that more and more women are taking, as across the globe strong female leaders emerge on the world’s political stage. And it’s about time! Because, honestly, many studies have shown, and many opinion pieces have been written, to demonstrate that when it comes to leading, women are, well… better at it.  Not only do “women have certain character traits that are beneficial for leadership, society, and… public stability”1 but according to Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International states: “there is evidence to show through research that when you have more women in public decision-making, you get policies that benefit women, children and families in general.”2So who are the women taking the spotlight as world leaders right now:1. Angela MerkelAs Chancellor of Germany since 2005, Angela Merkel, at the age of 65, tops the Forbes 2016 list of 100 Most Powerful women – her 10th year of taking the title. She’s also considered the de facto leader of the European Union, and was named Time magazine\"s Person of the Year in 2015. 2. Theresa MayAnother world leader, Theresa May is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Leader of the Conservative Party.  In David Cameron’s Conservative Party cabinet, she held the position of Home Secretary and Minister for Women and Equality. She is only the second woman to hold the post of UK Prime Minister, following in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher.3. Sheikh Hasina WazedPrime Minister of Bangladesh for the past 7 years, Sheikh Hasina Wazed previously served as Prime Minister from 1996 to 2001 and stands 36th on Forbes\" list of The World\"s 100 Most Powerful Women. She survived an assassination attempt in 2004 and three years later was arrested for corruption during the 2006–2008 Bangladeshi political crisis.4. Aung San Suu Kyi,Aung San Suu Kyi is the first State Counsellor in Myanmar.  She is one of the world’s best-known political prisoners, having been confined to house arrest for almost 15 years, and is also a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. She is unable to claim the titles of president or prime minister due to her marriage to a foreigner and so is titled State Counsellor – in real terms, she is the head of the government in Myanmar.5. Erna SolbergPrime Minister of Norway since 2013, Erna Solberg is the second woman to hold the position, overcoming an early diagnosis of dyslexia to serve as the country’s most powerful stateswoman.6. Saara KuugongelwaCurrent Prime Minister of Namibia and a representative of SWAPO with whom she went into exile at the age of 14, Saara Kuugongelwa spent many of her early years in Sierra Leone. She previously served as Minister of Finance from 2003 to 2015.7. Beata SzydłoPoland celebrates its third female Prime Minister in Beata Szydło – who is also vice-chairman of the Law and Justice party. She is also the first female leader in Poland to succeed another woman in office.8. Hillary ClintonSo she’s not a world leader (yet?) but no list of powerful women would be complete with Hillary Clinton.  Currently presidential candidate for the Democratic Party in America, Hillary is number 3 on the Forbes 2016 list of 100 Most Powerful women – and the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.  If elected, Hillary Clinton promises a focus on women’s rights.So, if you ever feel like something just can’t be done – look through this list and remember the women who have done seemingly impossible things before you.  When you’re busy forging your path through life, through business, through relationships and the day-to-day worries start weighing you down – remember what’s possible to achieve – and believe you can! http://www.forbes.com/sites/womenintech/2012/09/26/equality-is-great-but-what-about-the-real-benefits-of-women-in-leadership/#197fec7f1f2fhttp://www.ipsnews.net/2015/03/everyone-benefits-from-more-women-in-power/"

So if you’re going away – go sensibly, Here are some tips to keep your home safe 1. Check your alarm and beams are working before you go.  Get your system serviced if you haven’t for a while.2. Don’t tell the world you’re going by announcing it on social media. 3. Do tell your security company – and make sure they have a set of keys (or know who has one) in order to gain entry if something goes wrong. 4. Don’t pack up your car in full view of the street. 5. Install a timer to switch your lights on and off. 6. If you have a post-box at your gate, organise for a friend or neighbour to stop by and collect your mail – mail that’s built up is sure sign homeowners are away. 7. Think about employing a house-sitter, any kind of occupant is a deterrent. 8. You might think drawn curtains are more secure, but they’re also a giveaway to these who might be checking your house – leave some open if you can because the more normal your home looks the better. 9. Disconnect any non-essential electronics – and unplug your remote garage door (makes it much harder for thieves to gain entry!) 10. Just in case, put irreplaceable items or important documents in a safety deposit box – it’s always better to be safe than sorry!And of course, it goes without saying that you need Home Contents cover for absolute peace of mind while you’re away – find out more about 1st for Women’s Home Contents cover before you go on holiday!"

        "content": "“I can do things you cannot; you can do things I cannot; together we can do great things.”– Mother TeresaMother Teresa once said,” I can do things you cannot; you can do things I cannot; together we can do great things.” At 1st for Women, we know that when we embrace other women’s strengths along with our own, we quickly realize how much simpler it is to reach a mutual goal by coming together, merging our strengths and forging ahead in spite of the challenges thrown our way. When a woman helps another woman, they both benefit. And when women celebrate one another’s accomplishments, we’re all lifted up.Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, has publicly called on women to join her in elevating, embracing and encouraging each other, rather than fighting with one another, to reach their full potential as a united front. This is because when women work together, incredible things happen, as can be seen by these truly inspiring women:The sky is not the limitAsnath Mahapa and Regopotswe Maponya saw the golden opportunity to provide African girls and women with the chance to become trained and qualified pilots by bringing their individual strengths together and opening the African College of Aviation - the first flight training school to be 100% African owned and also the first to be entirely managed by African women. By opening the college, the pair of South Africans are doing their bit to transform the industry by training previously disadvantaged females who are passionate about aviation. This merging of their unique strengths and talents by Mahapa and Maponya shows that when women unite towards a common goal and bring their unique talents to the table, great things can be accomplished. Pass along an opportunitySpeaking of aviation, to celebrate Girls in Aviation Day on 24 September, a major American airline took 120 girls, who attend aviation schools and are part of non-profit programmes, to the sky aboard a charter flight from New York to Washington, D.C. as part of its Women Inspiring our Next Generation (WING) programme. Every single aspect of the flight is led by women at this annual celebration and it gives the girls a unique chance to discuss career opportunities in the aviation industry.One of the many women present at this year’s celebration was aviation pioneer Joy Walker, the airline’s first female pilot. Walker says the responsibility to encourage girls and women to get involved in aviation lies on all the female aviators who have already removed some of the stumbling blocks standing in the way. This highlights the importance of women helping one another realize the opportunities that are available to them, even from a young age. Merge your passion with your needsWhat we love is that women are doing amazing things together all over the world – just look at AfriGal, a team of all-female software engineers in Uganda, where, 20% of the entire population totalling 6,600,000 million people are at risk of having a child with sickle cells. That’s what inspired AfriGal to develop a low-cost phone app that helps detect sickle cell anaemia quickly, easily and affordably.The four enthusiastic ladies that make up this team are looking forward to changing the world through software. They are passionate about creating innovative software solutions for the African community, and they want other women to know that there are growing opportunities in the technology industry for women who are passionate about changing the world while working hand-in-hand with other women. At 1st for Women, we embody the ideology of uplifting, empowering and inspiring the women of South Africa to always put their best foot forward and put themselves first as much as possible. One way in which we are doing this is through the annual 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters protest walk. Being the primary sponsor of the largest peaceful protest of its kind, 1st for Women is giving thousands of people the opportunity to unite and say NO! to violence against women, showing that together, we can make a change. This year, 1st for Women will show the world that that there is so much strength and power in numbers, and we urge everyone to help us put South African women first. On the 20th of November 2016, 1st for Women invites everyone to join us and East Coast Radio as we bring the 1st for Women Sisters with Blisters protest walk to Durban at the Chris Saunders Park in Umhlanga for the very first time. We will also be walking as one in Johannesburg on the 26th of November at Montecasino in Fourways with Jacaranda FM. "

        "content": "How many times do you say ‘there are just not enough hours in the day!’?  Well, its unlikely there’ll be 25 hours in a day anytime soon – but there are a total of 1440 minutes. OK, so around 8 hours of that should be spent sleeping, but here’s how to reclaim some of the precious minutes that remain just for yourself.1. Do things the night before.  Put out clothes, pack bags for the next day, you can even make sandwiches and put them in the fridge ahead of time.Time saved in a day:  20 min2. Make bigger meals twice a week.  Cook a large amount, freeze half and voila: a couple of nights off from cooking!Time saved in a day:  60 min3. Send the kids to bed half an hour earlier.  You’ll have a delicious extra 30 minutes to yourself, and they’re unlikely to notice the difference.  On that note, make sure you stick to bedtimes!Time saved in a day:  30 min4. Don’t hit snooze.  You lose valuable minutes in a day on what isn’t really great sleep anyway!Time saved in a day:  15 min5. Delegate.  Yes, it’s hard, and you could probably do it better, but if you give someone else a chance to try, they may surprise you.  It’s also healthy for kids to be given chores, even if it’s just unpacking the dishwasher or feeding the dogs.  And you’ll save precious minutes, of course.Time saved in a day:  20 min6. Say ‘NO’ once a day.  It’s the unscheduled stuff that can derail your day.  Practice saying ‘no’ to just one thing a day that will stretch your capacity – think of it as saying ‘YES’ to yourself!Time saved in a day: 30 minIf you do all these simple things, you’ll have saved yourself nearly 3 hours a day.  That’s time you can fill with things that inspire you… Whether it’s a morning meditation, a coffee with a friend, or simply some time with a book at the end of a day."

        "content": "Growing up, the question of what we wanted to be sparkled with the promise and possibility of a fulfilling future. But as it turns out, life is not always glitz and glamour.You don’t always get what you want. You don’t always end up where you thought you would be. You don’t always have the kind of life you envisioned as a teenager. Before you know it, you find yourself stuck in a place where you feel uninspired, discouraged and just plain tired. You wake up one day and realize that you let your dreams, desires and aspirations slip out of your fingers.But here’s the joy of life: You have the power to turn your situation around at any given moment in time. You have the capability of changing the direction of your journey when you feel that you are not going where you want to go. Notice how extensively we use the word ‘you’? That’s because you have the power to follow and get your heart’s desire.So maybe you already know what kind of life you want, but just don’t know how to get there. We have a few tips on how you can achieve your heart’s desire in 5 easy steps.1. Visualize your end goalIt took 6 years for Zanele Sibiya to obtain her BSc degree in Physics and Electronics. Because she persevered and knew what her end goal was, she pushed ahead despite the numerous obstacles she faced, including severe health complications and financial strain. Visualizing your end goal is essential, especially when you start feeling discouraged. Zanele teaches us that if you know what you are working towards, then your heart’s desire won’t seem so out of reach.2. Start small and dream bigMathapelo Montsho and Yolanda Nomoyi teamed up to follow a passion they shared – Cooking! Because they knew they were going into a highly competitive market, the pair clearly outlined their distinctive approach, which is to provide traditional home cooked-style meals with a contemporary twist. The duo advises to start small and work your way up, like they did by taking on smaller, private catering jobs in order to raise enough money to branch out and target bigger corporate companies. Fulfilling your heart’s desire works the same way – start following your heart in small matters, and you’ll soon find yourself fulfilling those desires which seemed too big to achieve in the beginning.3. Take calculated risksAfter losing her job in 2015, Mbali Mncwabe bravely decided to take a leap of faith when she saw a gap in the ethnic hair market.  After carefully calculating all risks involved in starting a business without much capital, such as identifying her target market risk, evaluating the risk level of entering into partnerships, and creating a detailed plan of execution, she concluded that pursuing her desire was worth more than the risks, and that she would also get a greater return should her business be sustainable. Mbali took all her savings and opened Kiddies Korner in February 2016. She combined her passion for kids and hair, didn’t look back, and is now living out her dream of helping parents tame their kids’ hair. Mbali serves as encouragement to take healthy, calculated risks so that you can fulfil your heart’s desire.4. Enthusiasm is everythingDitshego Sedikela, affectionately known as ‘Dee, the Tea Lady’, saw an opportunity to turn her enthusiasm for tea into a passion. Dee acknowledged that because she didn’t have any experience in retail, all she had to go on was her ‘love of tea and a willingness to grow through whatever would come [her] way’. Today, Dee owns and operates 5 stores across Gauteng and prides herself on knowing that each store gives customers ‘the ultimate tea experience’. Dee’s story shows us that enthusiasm is one of the driving tool to fulfilling our hearts’ desires.5. Remember that failure is a toolWhen Thembi Ndimande failed to keep her first few business ventures afloat, she realized the importance of using failure as a guiding tool to fulfilling her heart’s desire. Not only did Thembi not give up on her entrepreneurial dreams; she decided to use the lessons she learned from her failed companies and establish a business summit which equips emerging entrepreneurs with the information they need to ensure that their businesses succeed. When you fail the first time around, giving up on your heart’s desire should not be an option because failure is a learning curve to do better the next time around.Making the decision to ultimately follow your heart is a lifelong journey. When you do make that decision, it will certainly bring more joy and fulfilment to your life. Are you on the path of following your heart’s desires or are you still finding the courage to pursue your dreams? Regret is one of the most tragic things in life. The best way to avoid it is to ultimately follow your heart.  "

        "description": "",
        "content": "Congratulations, you’re pregnant! You’re probably feeling a mixture of delight, fear and anxiety that you never knew was possible. Your hormones are up and down and you’ve got a million questions about your soon-to-be new addition to the family, especially if you’re a first-time mom: What kind of a mother will you be? Will you know what to do once the baby comes? Is the birth going to be painful? Can you give your child everything he or she needs? You may feel anxious about your baby, and that’s perfectly normal. But remember that she or he is going to have something that no other child in the world will have – that unique bond with you. Even his or her siblings won’t have the same kind of bond; each will be different but equally as beautiful and special. There is so much that goes into preparing the best environment and life for your child before you can bring them home, and making sure everything is in order can be overwhelming. This is why we’ve created a little checklist for you so that you can get the important things done and have more time to spend with your beautiful baby. So take a deep breath, relax for a few minutes, and read our advice for getting the necessities out of the way:Baby proofingYou might think that there isn’t much to do in terms of making your home a safe place for your new little one until he or she begins crawling or walking, but there are innumerable ways you can ensure their safety (and yours). Doing these things long before the baby comes means that you can fully enjoy this wonderful time in your life.Bathroom You’ll be spending a lot of time in the bathroom with your baby, so it’s best to make sure no harm comes to either of you! Get a non-slip mat for the bottom of the bathtub and move all of the beauty and cleaning products you keep on the side of the tub to a place where little hands can’t reach them. You’ll find that your bond will grow deeper every day, and so will your baby! He or she will begin crawling and walking in no time at all, so safety prepping long before that time comes is a must. Get a toilet lock so that their curious fingers don’t get squashed, store all of your medicines far out of reach, preferably in a locked cabinet, and if you keep things like your hairdryer or straightener in the bathroom, make sure they’re always unplugged when you’re not using them and keep them (and their cords) well out of reach.Bedroom Moms and babies alike need sleep, so the bedroom is the place where you are going to leave your baby alone for the most amount of time; it’s vital to make sure that no accidents can happen when you’re not there. A sturdy crib is the first item you should buy, and make sure that the slats are not too far apart – a cool drink should not be able to fit between them. Your baby will soon be able to grasp things and move him- or herself around a little, so should they fall out of the crib, you want them to be far away from windows and objects like heaters. Also, don’t put the crib against the wall where there are paintings or other wall décor that might fall down on top of them.Kitchen  You will create many wonderful memories with your child in the kitchen, such as baking birthday cakes or making muffins to sell at the school market day. But this is also where we store most of our hazardous detergents, so make sure to put child-proof locks on all kitchen cupboards, particularly those at eye level with your little one. If you feed your pets in the kitchen, never leave their kibble unattended. The same goes for kitty litter – don’t leave it in an area where your baby can reach it. When you’re cooking, never let pot handles hang over the side of the stove where they can be pulled down, and stove knob covers will stop her or him from turning the stove on.AdminIn addition to baby proofing your home, you’ll need to sort out some administrative matters too, before and after the birth. It’s not the most ‘idealistic’ part of having a baby, but is nonetheless necessary, and if you get it done early, you’ll have worry-free, quality time with your newborn. Registering your baby The Department of Home Affairs requires your baby to be registered within 30 days of being born. You’ll then receive an unabridged birth certificate which you should keep in a safe place. South Africa recently instated a law where parents must present an unabridged certificate for their children when travelling in and out of our country.Life insurance  As you have children, your responsibilities and priorities change, so you’re likely to want to change your life insurance policy to include your children as beneficiaries. This task will certainly take a backseat to caring for and developing a bond with your newborn, but don’t leave it too long to get sorted out. Health insurance Before your baby is born, make sure she/he will be covered on your health insurance or medical aid plan from birth. Home contents insurance  Baby products are expensive, so make sure that your home contents policy is up to date and you have the right amount of cover for all those cribs, monitors, play sets, and safety gadgets that you’re bringing into your house. At 1st for Women, we understand all the ups and downs that pregnant women and new moms go through. We think you should enjoy this time that is so fleeting and precious, which is why we tailor our insurance for your lifestyle, whether it’s life insurance or home contents insurance, we’ve got you and your family covered."

        "description": "",
        "content": "If you’re a full-time employee, then it’s possible that you see your colleagues more than you see your family and friends. Many women spend long hours at the office and the support structures they have in place at work are important, as these help them reach their professional potential. But when a relationship turns sour with someone at the office, it can impact on all other areas of your life, especially if you work closely with that person. Humans are social by nature and when a relationship is not OK, it can leave you feeling simply rotten, causing you to miss out on that much-needed relaxation in the evening because you can’t take your mind off the conflict of the day. And when you don’t get the rest you deserve after a hard day’s work, you’re less likely to achieve all that you’re capable of the next day. Why have good relationships with colleagues?  Whether you’re a social butterfly who sees work as a great place to make friends or you prefer to keep to yourself at the office, getting on well with your co-workers is important, both for your emotional wellbeing and for the quality of your work. When you’re stressed from conflict at the office, it can cause sleep deprivation, which can lead to cognitive impairment. What this means is that not only is this stress harming your body, but it’s affecting your work, too. It will also impact on some things that you probably wouldn’t have thought of, such as your commute to work. If you’re not concentrating on the road because you’re tired, you might be more likely to give your insurance company a call because you had a bumper bashing. But it doesn’t end there; stress can affect you in multiple other ways, such as causing frequent headaches, poor eating habits, fatigue, irritability, and more. All of these things compound and negatively impact your life, preventing you from being and doing your best. But when you look at this on the flip side and see how beneficial good relationships at work are, the effects are amazing. Research-based company, Gallup, says that when a person has a best friend at the office, they’re seven times more likely to be engaged in their work. While not many of us are lucky enough to work with our best friends, having good working relationships will certainly improve our professional performance. How do you maintain good work relationships?  At some point in your career, you will likely work with someone whom you don’t get along with, and this is simply a part of life. The best way to handle it is to maintain a professional and courteous relationship. If you’re finding it difficult to find common ground and keep communication professional, here are some ways that you can set the boundaries between the two of you:Commit to promises. This goes for work-related promises, like deadlines, and personal ones, like agreeing to attend a social gathering after work. If you’re swamped at work and aren’t sure if you’ll get the work done in time, be upfront about it. It might be frustrating for the other person to hear, but they’ll nevertheless appreciate your candour. Likewise, even if you’re exhausted after work, going to an event you said you’d attend will promote confidence in you from your colleagues.It’s OK to compromise sometimes.In every good relationship, there are compromises from both people. A compromise is a signal to another person that you’re willing to listen to them and that you care about their opinions. When you compromise, you can often inspire the other person to do the same, and in this way, develop a healthy give-and-take relationship.Spend time outside of work together.If you work with someone whom you don’t get along with, it can be daunting and unappealing to spend time with them outside of work, but often this can be the best thing for your relationship. It doesn’t mean that the two of you need to hang out alone, but if you’re in a social setting with other people, you might see another side to one another – a more relaxed and open side. Once you’ve seen that person outside of the pressure of work, you’ll gain greater insight into their character and feel more comfortable and confident when communicating at work.Recognise good workRecognition is a fundamental human desire, so when you see your colleagues have done excellent work, let them knowDon’t gossipA careless word can devastate a relationship, especially at work. While confrontation is often difficult to face, it is sometimes the best course of action. It is far better to try to sort out a problem with someone privately and in person than to talk to others about it.Set boundariesStanding up for yourself is important for so many reasons. You are worthy of respect, and when you stand up for yourself and your values, you’re not only letting other people know that you deserve their respect, but you’re affirming your own worth to yourself, tooConflicted, professional relationships can leave you feeling drained at work and at home, but they are sometimes unavoidable. But by being yourself and making the best of a tense situation, you’ll be creating a comfortable and happy working environment for yourself, and likely for those around you, too. 1st for Women gives you the opportunity to focus on your work and relationships as we take care of your insurance needs with great benefits such as Travel, Medical, and Home and Lifestyle. We offer these value-added benefits because we want to encourage you to be the best version of yourself you can be every day – we know you have it in you!"

        "content": "You\"ve read the decor magazines, you\"ve browsed the best homeware shops and you\"ve checked out the DIY aisles at your local hardware store. You\"re just about ready to embark on a massive home renovation. However, these kinds of projects can often go awry.The keys to a successful home improvement project are careful planning and the right people. With that winning combination, you\"ll be on your way to renovation success. Here are the steps you should take before you start your project.1. Draw up a careful plan of what needs to be doneThink carefully about what you want. Cut out pictures from magazines, take photographs of spaces that you love and sketch out your ideas for your home. Try to have a very clear image in your head of your idea so that you can explain it to other people.2. Get quotes and draw up a budgetGet quotes from multiple contractors to give you a sense of the costs involved as well as level of professionalism and range of services covered by each contractor. Itemised quotes will allow you to compare apples with apples, while bearing in mind that the cheapest quote is not necessarily the best one. Remember to ask about whether there will be additional quotes from electricians or plumbers if your work is going to be structural.You can use these quotes to draw up a budget and apply for finance from your bank if necessary. Remember, however well you plan and budget, building projects generally take longer and cost more. Make sure that you have allowed some contingency in your budget so that you can complete your project when those nasty hidden costs emerge.3. Ask to see prior work and speak to referencesAny decent architect, builder or decorator should have a portfolio of completed work to show to prospective clients. Assess the kinds of jobs that they have done before to make sure that they are competent enough for your job. You can even ask to do a site visit to get a sense of the finer details of their work.Even if a contractor was referred to you by a friend, it is still worth speaking to one or two other prior clients to get their impression of him or her. Their feedback and advice can be helpful not only in helping you to make your mind up about whether to go ahead, but also in managing the building or decorating process.4. Find out if they are registered with any professional organisationsBecause most builders and interior designers are independent contractors, you don\"t have someone higher up to complain to if things go wrong. However, if they belong to a professional association, these organisations will often get involved in mediating disputes, and will eject members who have behaved unprofessionally. Of course, you hope that nothing will go wrong, but it\"s nice to know that you have recourse if it does. In South Africa, interior designers can join the South African Institute of the Interior Design Profession, builders can be a part of Master Builders South Africa and architects have to register with the South African Council for the Architectural Profession although there may be regional or voluntary-membership bodies as well.5. Be sure that your project is legally compliantYou don\"t need planning permission for any interior changes, but some municipalities have restrictions on exterior changes or renovations on houses that are over a certain age. Be sure that you have researched the building restrictions in your area or complex so that you don\"t step on any toes or worse, get fined while your project is underway. If you are using an architect, they will generally do this for you.6. Make sure you are coveredSpeak to your home insurance and buildings insurance provider to make sure that you are still covered while a building project is on the go, and to find out whether there are any limitations or restrictions to what you can do. Remember that if your home improvement adds value to your property, you will also need to inform your insurer of this so that you are covered for the full value of your property.Make sure that your contractor also has professional liability insurance in place so that if anything goes wrong, he\"s covered.Get rebuilding, redesigning and redecoratingThey say a change is as good as a holiday. Well, soon, you\"ll be vacationing in your newly renovated home. It might take you a while to get to your final destination, but with the right planning and the right people on board to get you there, the process will be a whole lot easier and more fun."

Hot summer days mean that we can picnic outside, laze by the pool, and in certain parts of the country, experience sundown as late as 9pm.While some people do prefer a cooler climate, there is a certain atmosphere that takes over South Africa when the weather starts to warm up. We come out of hibernation and see our friends more; we wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing, and we’re fortunate that the season corresponds to year-end holidays by the beach with family, and Saturday afternoon braais with friends. But summer also has its troubles, one of the biggest being hail storms. Each year during the summer months, car insurance companies receive numerous vehicle claims for hail damage. Storms can cause so much damage to a vehicle that some drivers will be searching for new car insurance quotes before the end of the year.But hail doesn’t only affect cars; it can damage your home’s roof, smash windows, destroy your exquisite flowers that you’ve lovingly cultivated throughout the year, and damage valuable outdoor items like patio furniture and portable braais.When you’re working your hardest during these last, busy months of the year, replacing your windscreen and repairing your roof are the last things you should have to worry about. That’s why we’ve put together a list of some of the things you can do to protect yourself and your property from hail. Read on to find out our fail-safe tips for being hail-safe this season!

There are dozens of weather apps, such as Accuweather and GO Weather Forecast and Widgets, which will keep you up to date with the weather.When you know there is a big storm coming, it’s best to avoid driving. Visibility is significantly reduced during rainy weather, roads are slippery, traffic is slower, and traffic lights often stop working at the first hint of rain.If you are caught in a storm while driving, pull over to a safe, sheltered area if possible, such as a garage with covered parking or even better, an underground parking area in a shopping centre. It’s the perfect time to get the grocery shopping done, or to treat yourself to some retail therapy as a reward for your hard work!But staying off the road entirely is not always practical. You can stay safe, though, by checking that your wipers are in good condition before the season’s first hail storm. You can also use water repellent for your windscreen, which will help you to see clearly during a downpour. So whether you’re taking the kids to piano lessons or making your way to a business meeting during a storm, you can drive with the confidence that you’ll arrive safely.If you’re not driving in a hail storm, it’s still important to protect your car. Park it undercover if you can and, if not, you can buy car protectors from many local stores, or even use heavy blankets to lay on top of your vehicle’s roof and bonnet. Home safety Your house Cleaning your gutters regularly doesn’t sound like the most appealing task, but on the bright side, it’s a great workout! By keeping them clear from debris, rain and hail will be diverted away from your roof, lessening the chances of it being damaged, plus you’ll have the toned arms to show for it.If winds are particularly strong, you may have to deal with broken windows. While there isn’t much you can do to prevent this, closing curtains and blinds will help to stop the broken glass from smashing inwards all over your floor.Your garden If you’ve got patio furniture or expensive outdoor equipment like portable braais, bring them inside or move them to a sheltered area on your patio.Your fragile plants will also need a little extra attention to make sure they survive the hail storm. There are a number of ways to protect them:Plant extra soil around them to help keep them upright and stop the soil from washing away.Place heavy objects like pots and even rubbish bins over them before the storm hits, and add extra weight by placing bricks on top to weigh them downYou can cover plants with plastic sheeting by placing stakes in the ground and draping the sheeting over them, securing the sheeting to the stakes.Your petsDon’t forget your loveable four-legged family members! Ideally, your pets should be brought inside but if you simply can’t make it home in time to let them in, make sure they have a safe, dry, covered area to shelter in. However, if your pet has noise and/or storm phobia, it’s vital that they be brought inside.Hail storms might put a hold on your plans for a few hours, but don’t let them ruin the season by damaging your car and home. When you take out Comprehensive Car Insurance with 1st for Women, we give you the choice to take out hail cover. Your home is also looked after with our Buildings cover, and if your household goods are damaged by a storm, our Home Contents insurance will take care of those for you, too.With all of this value, you can focus on getting the important things done as the year draws to a close, without worrying about small things like hail damage.

        "content": "We often consider the importance of making sure that our vehicles are in tip-top condition before taking them on long road trips at this time of the year. Getting your tyres, oil, water, and other essentials checked is important, but we tend to forget that crime rates – especially violent crime – spike over the festive season, so we need to be extra careful when it comes to staying safe on the road.1st for Women provides you with car insurance that is tailor-made for your lifestyle and that will help keep you safe; our Guardian Angels are there for you if you’re stuck with a flat tyre, they will bring you petrol if you run out, or they’ll keep you company if you simply need someone to wait with you when you’ve broken down. We’ll also support you with our Trip Monitor benefit when you’re out enjoying the end-of-year celebrations. But we can’t look after you every second you’re on the road, although we wish we could. This is why we’ve put together some helpful tips for staying safe and keeping you ready to take on anything from the time you leave the house in the morning to the moment you arrive home in the afternoon or evening: Leaving home Before you jump into your car in the morning, whether you’re taking the kids to school, on your way to work, popping out to the shops or heading to the gym, walk around to the boot and securely lock all of your valuables in there. This includes your handbag, gym togs, smartphone, or the kids’ school bags. If there are no visible, easily-snatched valuables in your car, you’re less likely to become a target for opportunistic criminals.When you leave your house or complex in the morning, you are at heightened risk. If possible, drive out of the gate forwards rather than reversing out. This way, you can see what is on the road and the pavement better, and you have more control over your vehicle. TrafficOn the way to your destination, you stop at numerous traffic lights and stop streets, and all of these are areas where you’re at heightened risk. You’re probably watching the intersection and the cars around you so that you safely obey the rules of the road. Unfortunately, when you’re distracted or concentrating hard, it is easier for criminals to hijack or smash and grab your handbag from the front seat or your phone from your hand if you haven’t locked these in the boot.If you leave early in the morning, you’re likely going to hit rush hour traffic, especially if you live in a major metropolitan area. But just because there are loads of other cars and people around, doesn’t mean you’re less vulnerable. In fact, if you are in bumper-to-bumper traffic, that means you can’t drive off to escape an attacker, and if you’re underneath a highway or next to open land, the criminals could make off with your valuables before you even know what’s happened. To get around this, leave extra room between your car and the one in front of you so that you might be able to manoeuvre around it if you need to getaway.If you’re concerned about your safety on the road at any time, you can use our Trip Monitor service, where we’ll contact you every 30 minutes to make sure you’re OK and that you’re where you need to be.  Parking Once you’ve arrived at your destination, you will need to be careful if you park in a public area without good access and egress control. Before unlocking your door and getting out, look around you. If you see someone who seems suspicious or who appears to be approaching your car, rather drive around the block to make sure it’s safe before parking and exiting the vehicle.Physically check that your car is locked before walking away. Modern cars with remote locking systems are great, but we often take them for granted, which is just what criminals with remote jammers want us to do. Coming home When you’re going back to your car after work or picking the kids up from their dancing lesson, check again that there are no suspicious-looking people or cars around and don’t unlock the doors from a distance. And remember that criminals don’t fit a single profile; they are just as likely to be dressed smartly and drive expensive cars as they are to be unkempt.When you’re arriving home, don’t turn into your driveway until the gate has opened fully and you can drive straight in; it is easy for criminals to hem you in between the gate and their car and prevent you from getting away.If you need to get out of the car to open and close a manual gate, you should consider investing in an automatic one. Other precautions There are other precautions you can take to make sure that you and your vehicle remain looked after. One is to have comprehensive car insurance so that if your car is stolen, you’ll be insured for it. You can also have anti-smash-and-grab film put on your car’s windows; this prevents criminals from having a clear view of your vehicle and it will hold shattered glass in place, giving you more time to get away and protecting you from shards of broken glass. You can also install a tracking device that will help authorities to trace your vehicle if it’s stolen, and you might also get a reduced vehicle insurance premium from your insurance company if you have an approved one installed.Unless you never leave home again, you cannot ever truly avoid the risk of crime on the road. But it shouldn’t be something that prevents you from going out and doing your best every day.If you are the victim of a crime, never blame yourself. These things happen no matter how much you prepare, and remember that the best way to handle the situation is to remain as calm and co-operative as possible."

        "description": "",
        "content": "With New Year’s over, many people may be struggling to stay committed to the goals they made at the beginning of 2016. But even the act of staying dedicated to a goal that makes you happy, whether it’s exercising, eating healthy, or putting in the hours to make a fledgling business take off, can fulfil you and make you a better person.Commitment is a part of life that you often don’t realise you’re even doing. You make small commitments each day, from the mundane, like calling your insurance company when you need to update your homeowner’s insurance, to the bigger promises, like being there for your bestie on her wedding day.Most of the time, these commitments go by without you even realising that you’re keeping your word on something, but every now and then, you may come to a point in your life when you find you’re lacking the motivation to stay dedicated to something. This could be with just about anything – a personal goal, career, studies, business, partner, or a friend.Commitment is important, but it can take on different forms. Staying committed to your spouse is essential, but committing to leave a relationship that does not make you the best person you can be is also important! So while sticking to your commitments and promises makes you a person whose word others can trust, it’s just as important to make sure that who or what you’re committed to is helping you be at your best.If you’re struggling to stay committed to something or someone, it might be time to evaluate why your motivation is low and, if it’s the best thing for you, work on getting it back up again.What is holding you back? The answer to this depends on your unique circumstances, but to move forward and stay committed, this is the first question to answer. Why is it so hard to go to the gym? Are you too tired after work, or are you not getting enough sleep at night? Why do you put off studying? Why do you find it hard to practise the guitar, even though it’s one of your favourite past times? Are you afraid to turn your part-time business into a full-time enterprise? Whatever the reason, you’ll find that, almost every time, the thing that is holding you back is not unmanageable, and what you fear most is often not as bad as you think.Whatever the reason for holding back, don’t feel bad. It’s perfectly OK to say, “I’m not going to the gym today because I am tired from working hard.” Sometimes you need to cut yourself some slack and, when you do, you might find renewed motivation.It’s also important to ask yourself if this is something you really want. You might be taking a course to make you better at your job, but if you’ve got a sinking feeling every time you attend a lecture or webinar, it might be time to reconsider your decision to study further.Know that you’re good enoughOften, you might feel like you’re not ready to tackle a goal or a dream because you think you’re not quite there yet – you think you haven’t got enough experience to apply for that dream job, or you don’t enter that fitness contest because you feel you haven’t trained hard enough.Remember that, no matter how good you get at something or how much you know, there will always be more to learn. If not knowing enough is holding you back, you’ll never commit to a goal.Also know that everyone feels this way sometimes, even people whom you think have it all together. We all have doubts, and the best way to get past them is to push through them.Plan, plan, plan The key to achieving any goal, no matter how big or small, is to plan. Some goals, like creating a business plan, take months of in-depth planning and organising, while others, like calling your insurance company for updated homeowner’s insurance quotes, take only a few minutes to plan. But whatever the goal, a little planning can go a long way to keeping your inspiration going.Be accountable Being accountable to someone else will help you to see your goal through. This doesn’t mean that they are there to shout at you and pull you down if you fail; rather, it’s someone to remind you why you began in the first place, to help you remember that feeling of motivation you started out with, and to think of how great you’ll feel when you’ve achieved what you set out to. Your support system will be able to help you with this; a phone call every few days from your mom or a coffee catch up once a week with your best friend can be the difference between seeing something through and giving up.Committing is important in many ways – we grow from it, we learn from it, and when we achieve something, we feel pride in ourselves and gratitude for those who helped us. But don’t feel that you have to stick with something or someone just because you said you would; if you’re in a situation that is bad for you, taking a step back and reconsidering may be the best course of action.1st for Women is committed to giving women more than just insurance; we promise to give you value with our service. That’s why we tailor-make our insurance for women, because we understand the unique needs and challenges you face. Whether it’s car, business or house insurance, we support you through our benefits made just for you."

        "content": "Your car is more to you than just a way to get from A to B. It takes you on well-deserved holidays, keeps you moving from work to home, and safely carries your precious family. But to keep doing this, it needs to be taken care of. That’s where 1st for Women comes in. We know how much you rely on your car to help you on your life’s journeys, which is why we offer a range of vehicle-related insurance options including Car, Motorbike, Caravan, and Trailer Insurance, as well as Vehicle Warranty.You can also keep your beloved car in good condition by servicing it at the right intervals at a reputable dealer. And it’s a great feeling when you get it back from the mechanic after a service and it’s clean and shiny and everything is running smoothly.To make the most of your services, it helps to know a little bit about what needs to be done, how much it should cost, and how long it should take. And while learning the ins and outs of a car is time-consuming and impractical for many people, there are some basics that will help you make the best decisions for you and your vehicle. 1. Get quotes Because, as a woman, you’re a careful and great decision-maker, you might want to get quotes before deciding on a mechanic. You should be able to get an estimate on how much a standard service would cost, and by phoning around to different places, you’ll get a good idea of what you should be paying. Remember, too, that your service book will likely specify what is required for every major service, so use this as a guide on what needs to be done.Of course, there is the possibility that your vehicle will need more than the standard service, but at least you can accurately gauge what you should be paying for the regular items. 2. Ask a friend One of the best ways to shop around for anything is to listen to referrals from your friends and family. Ask your loved ones to recommend someone; this is a better guide to good service than just about anything else. 3. Ask for replaced parts There isn’t much you can do with the parts of your car that have been replaced, but by seeing what has been changed, you’ll know that you’re getting exactly what you paid for. 4. Ask to be consulted Good mechanics will consult with you before doing any repairs over and above the standard service. But in any case, it’s a good idea to ask that they get the go-ahead from you before proceeding. After you’ve carefully planned your finances and researched a good mechanic, it can be a shock if you get a big bill that you haven’t budgeted for. And remember to get all quotes in writing, so that you take care of yourself; this way you can have recourse should any repairs be done without your permission. 5. Inspect the car You’ll need to be fairly clued up on your car if you’re going to inspect all the work is done to it, which isn’t realistic for most people. However, check out what you can before you leave the workshop. For example, if your air-con needed re-gassing or your air filters need to be replaced, check that the air conditioning is working nicely. 6. Be upfront If you have a problem with your car, telling the mechanic about it will lessen the time the repairs take. They will also know what to look out for when they’re working on your vehicle, so you’ll get better service. 7. Stand up for yourself Regardless of your mechanical knowledge maybe, you know your car better than anyone else. If something doesn’t feel right with it, there is nothing wrong with standing up and saying so.So now that you know how to make the best decisions when taking your vehicle for a service, you can achieve what is most important to you, knowing that you’ve taken care of your car.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Can women have it all? Yes. And no. OK, we admit it. This is a loaded question because really, what does ‘having it all’ actually mean? This phrase has typically referred to career women who are juggling their work responsibilities and taking care of their families. But because women are all so uniquely different, they can’t be boxed into singular roles like ‘family woman’ or ‘career girl’. These terms are often intended to be mutually exclusive; you can be one or the other, but not both. However, we know this to definitely not be true. We know that women do fulfil multiple roles, and the most important definitions they have are the ones they give themselves, rather than what others say they are or should be. Having it all should be more about how you feel about what you do, have done and are going to do in the future, and less about fitting into a narrow definition of ‘the delicate balance’. Sure, there will be times when you don’t feel balanced. There will be times when one aspect of your life needs more focus than others, and that’s OK – to be fit enough to run the Comrades, you need to put in hours upon hours of training and hard work which may mean having to miss out on other social activities. But that’s fine, because in the end, it will be worth it. Having goals is healthy, but achieving balance is not some unattainable dream that you constantly need to strive for. The reality is that it is possible to have it all and maintain a balance, because having it all depends on how you define it on your own terms. To one woman, it might be the family and work balance, while to another, it could be work and studies, and yet to another, it may be about making enough time for her beloved hobbies. It is about prioritising what is important to you and how this shapes the choices you make. Why do we need to have balance? We all want balance in our lives; too much time spent at work and we miss out on important family events. Too much time spent with others, and we notice we’re sorely lacking precious me-time. It’s natural to want balance. This rings particularly true when it comes to work-life balance. If you have a healthy balance between work and your personal life, you can be more present when spending time with your loved ones and feel more relaxed and comfortable with yourself. And it also benefits your work – if you’re less stressed, you can perform at your best. At 1st for Women, we think that it’s more important to reshape the conversation and redefine what balance is and what having it all means on your own terms. It’s impossible to balance every aspect of your life all the time in the traditional sense – there are not enough hours in the day! But what can go a long way to maintaining a sense of balance is to recognise what areas of our lives need a little extra care and working on doing more of the things that make us happy. Putting yourself first  We know that, as a woman, you do so much for so many and seldom put yourself first. But now is the time to start recognising and celebrating you, giving yourself the praise you deserve. When you acknowledge what you’ve done, you are building the confidence to take on new challenges and opportunities that come your way, helping you be the best version of yourself, which inevitably, will bring you balance. And you know what? If you don’t feel balanced, that’s fine too, as long as you are happy with where you are and what you’re doing. At 1st for Women, we aim to provide the support that women need so that they have the confidence to do what they need to do. Whether it’s our Guardian Angels Lifestyle Assistance that gives you that extra pair of hands you’ve always wanted, or comprehensive household contents insurance that keeps your precious valuables safe, we offer a tailor-made insurance solution for women. If you’re looking for house contents cover and the best building insurance for women, call us on 0861 91 77 73.

        "content": "The wonderful thing about Women’s History Month is that it reminds us that lists of courageous women like these are not exhaustive; all women are courageous in their own ways, each day. It doesn’t take breaking a world record or living in imprisonment to be courageous. You don’t need to compare yourself to these brave women, but rather celebrate the smaller, daily, seemingly insignificant achievements that, in the end, make a big difference in your life and the life of others. Amelia Earhart  “Never interrupt someone doing what you said couldn\"t be done.” If taking to the skies and flying to the highest altitude the world had ever known at the time isn’t courageous, we don’t know what is! In 1928, Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and the first person to fly over both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. A few years later she did what no person had done before and flew to a height of 18 415 feet. She also joined a group of pilots called the Ninety-Nines that were out to encourage women to become pilots, and was later made president of this organisation. In 1937, she disappeared while attempting to fly around the world and no one knows the details of what happened to her after this. But to this day, she is a household name not just in her home country of America, but all over the globe she tried to circumnavigate. What’s truly inspiring about her is that we’ve all got a little of the kind of courage she had – the bravery to do something even when others think it can’t be done, no matter how big or small. Queen Ana de Sousa Nzinga Mbande  \"Haughtiness and proudness is in my soul from the day I was born until my dying breath.” Queen Nzinga Mbande is one of Africa’s greatest heroines. She was tough, resilient, and fought determinedly to free Africans from slavery in the 17th century. She ruled over the country known today as Angola with cunning and fearless resolve. To fight the Portuguese, whom at the time were trying to wrest control of the region and grow their slave trade, she declared her kingdom a sanctuary for runaway slaves, stating that all who lived there would be free people. In doing so, thousands flocked to her country and joined her army. What makes her even more impressive is how she also used her wits and personality to defend her country, too; she made an alliance with the Dutch to secure freedom for her region and for slaves. She was also determined to steer the country into a centre of power for trade, and although the slave trade grew after her death, she was responsible for fending off the Portuguese and slavery for her people during her time as queen. Miep Gies  “Even an ordinary secretary or a housewife or a teenager can, within their own small ways, turn on a small light in a dark room.” Anne Frank is a household name around the world, but the people who risked their lives to keep the Frank family alive are not as well known. One of these was Hermine Santruschitz Gies, better known as Miep Gies, who worked as a secretary for Otto Frank and helped to hide his family for over two years. She would take food for the family with illegal ration cards from various grocers, all while assisting with keeping the business going. Eventually the Franks were found and Miep saved Anne Frank’s diary which is so famous today. She delivered it to Otto Frank when he returned from the concentration camp. What we love most though about Miep is her humbleness. She has never seen herself as a hero; she merely did what she believed was the right thing to do. How many of us can relate to this? We don’t see ourselves as heroes in our everyday lives, and yet we have a profound positive impact on the world around in the small things we do.  Ruby Bridges  “Don’t follow the path. Go where there is no path and begin the trail. When you start a new trail equipped with courage, strength and conviction, the only thing that can stop you is you.” It’s hard to know who is the real heroine in this situation – Ruby Bridges, her mother Lucille, or her teacher. Ruby was just six years old when she made history in America. She was the first black child to attend a white Southern elementary school. She had to be escorted to school by her mother and U.S marshals to keep her safe, and only one teacher agreed to teach her – Barbara Henry. Parents of all of Ruby’s classmates pulled their children from the class, so Barbara and Ruby spent a year alone together at the school. At the time, Lucille Bridges knew the intelligence of her daughter and pushed for her to attend the school as she knew she would get a good education there, despite the risks involved. Although Ruby says she was too young to know what racism was or meant when she first attended the William Frantz School, she realised after her first year there that no one is born hating others because of the colour of their skin – racism is learned. As she grew older, her courage to embrace herself for who she was is something we can all look up to; simply being and loving yourself can be the bravest thing a person can do. At 1st for Women, we recognise that all women have courage in their own way. That’s why we know you deserve tailor-made insurance, whether it’s Car, Home, Portable Possessions or Bike Insurance. If you’re looking for cover that understands your unique needs, you can get insurance quotes online or call us on 0861 00 30 01."

        "content": "Valentine’s Day means a lot of things to people: it’s a romantic night off for hard-working parents or the giddy anticipation of a first date; it could be a quiet evening spent at home with your partner or a night to let loose with your friends. Whatever it means to you, we’re going to help you make the most of it with some pretty DIY crafts, tasty food treats, and different ways you can spoil yourself.CraftsYou could buy your partner a plushy heart or a soft toy, but because retailers increase the prices of red roses, hearts, teddies, and chocolates around Valentine’s Day, you’re better off making something for your partner yourself. Plus, it will come from the heart. Coffee cup sleeve  If your partner loves a good Cup of Joe, why not make them a homemade coffee cup sleeve? You’ll stop them from burning their fingers on hot cups, plus they’ll have something that is totally unique and useful to show off, made with love by you. To make one, you’ll need felt, craft scissors, sewing supplies, and craft glue, which you can obtain from your local material and craft store. Martha Stewart has a stunning tutorial to make one, which you can find here. DIY gift wrap  If you’d like to add a touch of your personality to your Valentine’s Day present, why not make your own gift wrapping paper? Here are some ideas: Paper box  There are numerous templates you can find online for folding a paper or cardboard gift box. Within you can hide chocolates, hard candies or jewellery, giving your valentine a double surprise. Gift wrap  If you’re feeling especially creative, you can make your own gift wrapping paper. You could buy plain gift wrapping paper and add your own special touch to it, such as with cut-out cardboard hearts or by making patterns using glitter pens or coloured markers. There are plenty of tutorials online that will help you bring out your creative side, and it will look so good, your partner won’t want to rip it apart!BakingIf you’re not into crafting your own present, why not bake your way into your loved one’s heart? Here are a couple lovely recipes and ideas to spoil them this year: Red velvet milkshakes  If your partner loves the chocolatey goodness of red velvet, you can shake up the traditional cupcakes and make red velvet milkshakes instead. All you’ll need is some vanilla ice-cream, red velvet cake mix, vanilla extract and milk. Mix all of these together until they’re smooth and voila, you and your partner will be sipping on delicious romance! You can get the recipe here. Jam cookies  Also known as Linzer cookies, these jam-filled delights are easy to make and are a heartfelt gift. You can cut them into any shape you want, but hearts are always popular for Valentine’s Day. Find the recipe here. Love yourselfIf you don’t have a partner, there is no reason that you can’t shower yourself with love and gifts. In fact, you don’t need Valentine’s Day as an excuse to show yourself some gratitude. Any of the ideas in this blog would make a lovely gift for you, but here are a few more ideas: Dinner with friends  Grab a friend or family member who has no special plans for Valentine’s Day and treat yourselves to a night out. It’s important to indulge yourself from time to time for all the wonderful things you always do for everyone else. Remember that 1st for Women offers numerous benefits that will help you enjoy a grand night out, such as organising a cab ride home with our Concierge Assist, and our Cellphone Insurance, which covers your phone in the event that it is lost or stolen while you’re out and about. Do something new  Do something on Valentine’s Day that you wouldn’t normally do on any other day of the year. You could treat yourself to a set of cute pyjamas, or luxurious bath soap, or book a day at the spa. Make it your day and make it all about you. Whatever you do and whomever you spend Valentine’s Day with, 1st for Women will help you to make it a memorable day. We offer a range of benefits to help make it special, such as Entertainment Assist, which will help you make bookings for restaurants and hotels, and Portable Possessions, Handbag, and Cellphone Insurance, so that you can enjoy a night out without having to worry about your possessions."

        "description": "",
        "content": "Did you know that the word ‘honeymoon’ comes from the Old English ‘hony moone’ ? ‘Hony’  referred to the period of time at the beginning of a marriage that consists of tenderness and pleasure, while ‘moone’  referred to the waning sweetness of initial love.1 In other words, the term referred to the blissful time at the start of a marriage, but also warned that this feeling does not last forever. That isn’t to say that a relationship is never as good as it is at the beginning – for many couples, their love only grows with time – but the nature of a relationship changes and those initial emotions of butterflies fade after a while, replaced by deeper, more mature feelings. You might enjoy a feeling similar to that of honey moone in all kinds of relationships, not only romantic ones. You can feel giddy when you make a new friend, excited about starting a new job, and tickled about getting a new car! Think of that feeling you get when you’re on your way to the dealership to pick up a new ride, and consider how you take out excellent comprehensive car insurance so that, if something happens to your new four-wheeled baby, it will be looked after.Maintaining a loving and healthy relationship is different for every couple. There is no right or wrong way to do it; if what you’re doing is working for you and you make each other happy, then you’ve figured out the secret to your unique relationship! But there are a few things that work in just about every relationship that help to maintain a respectful and loving connection once the butterflies have worn off.Communication is key: There is a difference between talking and communicating, between listening and hearing. Constructive and meaningful communication is the foundation of a lasting relationship, and it is two-way. Talking to one another is particularly important when you have conflict, and it is just as essential to understand your partner’s point of view as it is to get them to appreciate yours. You don’t have to always agree with each other, but it is vital to respect one another’s opinions.Communication is not only for resolving conflicts, though. It’s also the best way to get to know your partner! Sharing your hopes, dreams, fears, loves and vulnerabilities will bring you closer and make your connection more intimate.Make time for each other: When you start dating, you think of your partner almost constantly; a shared joke suddenly comes to your mind when you’re concentrating on something else entirely, and it can make you smile or giggle at the most inopportune times. You constantly wonder when you’ll see them next, and soon as you’ve said goodbye, you’re making plans to meet again.But as your relationship goes on, especially when you live together or you’re married, you get used to seeing one another; soon you’re not making time for each other quite as often. Maybe you watch television at night. Maybe you spend your evenings working. Maybe you get lost in the world of a book on the weekends. All of these are great ways to spend your time! But it’s important to set aside time for just you two every now and then, whether you go on a date or you turn off the TV, laptops, tablets and smartphones and simply talk to each other.Remember your interests: It’s important to keep your hobbies and interests alive. If your partner does not share the same interests as you, you can still participate in them. By enjoying things outside of your relationship, you can bring new and interesting perspectives and experiences to your partnership. And if you do share interests, then it’s an extra opportunity to bond and strengthen your relationship!Give and take: No one can get what they want all the time. And even if we did, it wouldn’t always be in our best interests. When you consider your own needs in addition to what your partner needs, you’re more likely to find a middle ground where you’ll both be happier.Pick your battles: There are bound to be things that your partner does that irritate you or even make you angry. It’s OK to feel like this sometimes, but it’s important to pick your battles, too. Not everything is worth addressing – sometimes it’s better to accept that little flaw that is part of who they are and rather focus your efforts and communication on more important things. Creating lasting relationships with our clients is important to us, which is why we offer value with our cover. In every dealing with 1st for Women, we hope to support you to be at your best, whether you’re speaking to our call centre consultants to make a claim, are in need of assistance from our trauma counselling line, or you’re simply getting car insurance quotes online.

        "description": "",
        "content": "You’re constantly faced with decisions, like choosing what colour socks you’re going to wear today, or deciding if it’s worth it to stay up an extra hour to watch another episode of Orange is the New Black.  If only all choices were so easy, but they’re not. For women, when it comes to making major decisions, like choosing life cover or picking a school for our children, we are often cautious and think carefully, which is why we’re usually such great decision makers.  Studies have shown that referrals and word of mouth are incredibly important to women. When we make decisions that impact our lives and families, we want what’s best for them, and having our loved ones affirm and assist our choices is important to us. We’re actually more likely to trust our friends and family than an advert, and this also means that our moms, sisters, friends, and colleagues rely on us to help them make the right choices, too.1  Our reliance on referrals is becoming even more important as women have become major decision-makers at the companies they work at, in their households, and their personal lives – studies suggest that many are responsible for the majority of decisions that affect their families, including where and what they eat, how money is spent, where vacations are taken, and more.2  So it’s clear that you take on a lot of responsibilities!  When you’re taking on so many roles and making so many choices in your life, how else can you ensure that you’re doing the right thing for yourself and your family? Here are some other ways:  Google  If you’d like to find out a little about a product before you buy it, you can perform a Google search of reviews and see what comes up. With websites dedicated to reviewing, complimenting, and complaining about brands and their products, you can get to know the ins and outs of a company in minutes and make more informed decisions on just about anything, whether it’s choosing from the life insurance quotes you’ve received, or deciding what kind of car to get. Some of these review sites include Hellopeter.com for customer service, TripAdvisor for accommodation, and Zomato for restaurants.  Social Media   Studies suggest that 74% of people rely on social media when making purchasing decisions.3 Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest are a way for people to make a personal connection with brands; we feel less like a mere customer and more like people talking to other people. While it’s not a definitive indication that you should buy a product or service if a company is interesting on social media, seeing how it interacts with people can give you a good idea as to whether it’s right for you and your family.  But despite all of these means of gathering information, one of the most important remains consulting our close, trusted community of friends, family or colleagues and considering their invaluable advice and experiences. And with your busy life, the supportive friends and family you surround yourself with is becoming ever-more important to help you make the decisions that are best for you and your family  Because we know how important your supportive network of loved ones is, we’re rewarding you for giving your friends and family some good advice by referring them to 1st for Women during February and March 2016. For every three people you refer to us who receive a quote, we’ll give you a R1000 shopping voucher to spend at Woolworths. You can refer up to 10 people, so you could get some serious, well-deserved retail therapy just for being the awesome friend, daughter, mom, aunt, cousin, colleague, and sister that you are!

        "content": "We’ve talked before about the women economy, also known as ‘womenomics’, and how women are making waves in the worlds of business, tech, and just about everywhere else. Recent figures suggest that in first-world countries like the United States, the number of women in the workplace has grown tremendously; 65 years ago, only a third of American women held jobs, whereas now that figure sits at two-thirds, with a half of the US workforce being comprised of women. But the developing world is also seeing its fair share of female growth in the workplace, and The Economist reports that this has contributed immensely to global growth and the global economy. As women are a potent and driving force behind the global economy and workplace, we thought we’d look at some of the inspiring women in business and STEM (science, tech, engineering and maths) and see how they’re leading the way in innovation. Sheryl Sandberg Being Chief Operating Officer for the biggest social media network in the world is no easy job, but Sheryl Sandberg pulls it off with her intelligence and savvy business acumen. But her impressive career didn’t start there; she was prominent at Google, the World Bank, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury before joining Facebook. While there, she’s helped the social network giant expand its global operations for the past eight years and has been on the board of directors since 2012. In addition to all of this, she has also published a book titled Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead, a bestselling non-fiction book about her passion for getting more women into leadership positions in all sectors. She encourages women to know and believe that they are truly worthy of the praise they receive and the success they achieve. You can find out more about it Lean In here. Mae C. Jemison Mae C. Jemison’s career has spanned several decades where she’s earned achievement after achievement. She dreamed of being a scientist from a young age, and made her dreams come true when she became the first black woman in space. Outdoing peers her own age, she enrolled at Stanford University at the age of 16 with a scholarship, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering, after which she entered Cornell Medical College and received her M.D. After working as a GP and a Peace Corps medical officer in Sierra Leone and Liberia, she secured a position in NASA’s astronaut training programme. When she left NASA, she established The Jemison Group Inc., which has worked on multiple sustainable development projects, with a flair for innovation and a passion for helping others. Ursula Burns  Growing up, many people told Ursula Burns she had three strikes against her: “I was black. I was a girl. And I was poor,” she says. But her mother told her a different story. She encouraged her daughter to get an education and strive for her dreams no matter how wild they might seem to others. Ursula joined Xerox in 1980 as an intern and, with her business acumen and Master of Science in mechanical engineering, climbed through the company ranks, culminating in being named CEO of the company in 2009. In addition to guiding a leading company in the document technology industry, she is a model of innovation in her own right, overcoming many challenges and personal fears to be named as a Power Woman in 2015 by Forbes. Mildred Dresselhaus  When you’re known as the Queen of Carbon Science, you can be sure you’ve created a legacy for yourself that will last beyond your lifetime. Mildred ‘Millie’ Dresselhaus is currently Institute Professor of Electrical Engineering and Physics at MIT. Like some of the other women in this blog, Millie overcame enormous odds in her childhood; she grew up in poverty during the Great Depression. Despite this, she defined her own future, one that has been immensely successful in a number of areas of scientific study.; she has specialised in magneto-optics in semiconductors and electronic structures of semimetals, which led to a greater understanding of graphite. Many industries, such as the vehicle insurance industry, take the progress made with graphite for granted, which is used in components like brake linings, clutches, and gaskets. Mildred has also published several notable scientific works. Regina Agyare If you’ve started your own business, you understand the courage it takes to begin that rewarding but difficult journey. Regina Agyare is a resourceful woman who dug deep and took the leap to begin her lifelong dream – to start her own business and help others with her vision. She is the founder and CEO of Soronko Solutions, a software development company that helps small-to-medium businesses in Ghana grow and develop with technology. The company also helps young Ghanaian girls develop the skills and thinking to learn how to code and introduce them to the world of STEM. Luckily for the world, Regina followed her entrepreneurial instinct and will help a new generation of rock star female developers add their skills to the tech industry.

        "content": "The older you become and the more you grow, you may find that the roles you fulfil change over time, too. Even in a single day, you go from being an aspiring athlete on your morning run, to a businesswoman at work in the day, to a dear shoulder to cry on in the afternoon, to a mom helping with homework in the evening, to a chef making dinner at night – your roles are almost endless.This is why our life insurance is tailor-made for you no matter what roles you take on or what stage of your life you’re in. We protect you with our All Women Cancer Policy, our Pure Life cover, which has different levels of protection, as well as Dread Disease, Disablement, and Expo-Sure life insurance. In addition to life cover, technological innovations also make our lives better and easier, from reducing risk of death during pregnancy and childbirth, to making sure we arrive home safe on a night out. That’s why we thought we’d give some of these inventions a nod of recognition for helping us be at our best. Here are some of our favourites:AppsSafety for a night outYou probably carry your smart phone with you wherever you go, so it makes sense that these devices could become one of your best lines of defence when it comes to your personal safety. There are a number of apps that offer ways to make sure you’ll be safe when you’re out and about. Kitestring is an excellent one that you can schedule to check in on you when you know you’re going to travel through an unsafe area.You select how often you’d like it to message you, and if you don’t respond, it will send a custom message that you create to your emergency contacts and let them know that you may not be OK. What’s great about the app is that it doesn’t require you to do anything, such as enter a pin code or shake the device, to let your loved ones know you might be in trouble. Sharing for moms If you’re a mom, you probably feel like you can see your children growing right before your eyes, but modern tech has made it simple and fun for you to embrace your time with them and relive those memorable moments, while still keeping in touch with friends and family. Apps like Lifecake make taking pics and videos of your children enjoyable and interactive.It lets your family and friends see and comment on what you share, and it’s entirely safe because only people you choose to share with will be able to view the memories. It’s a brilliant way to shorten the distance between you and your littlies, and grandparents, uncles, aunts, and friends, helping you be the best mom, daughter, niece and friend you can be. Plus, you can look back and see how they’ve grown because the app keeps track of how old your little ones are as you capture your best moments with them. Menstruation Let’s face it: menstruation is a nightmare for many women. It can be difficult to concentrate at work when you’re in pain or when you’re running to the loo every half hour, and the cost of sanitary products like pads and tampons can add up pretty quickly every month. It can also drastically interfere with the lives of women in developed countries, which has serious consequences, such as girls missing too many days of school. This is why menstrual cups are being lauded by women all over the world. These simple, modern devices are mostly made of silicone and a single one can last for years, making them much more affordable and practical for women of all ages in all countries. Contraception It’s easy to forget just how much better modern-day contraceptives have made our lives, which is exactly why they’re so effective – we don’t have to remember them all the time. Making sure we take a pill each day is no longer our only option; we have injections, intrauterine devices that can be effective for up to five years, and implants that are effective up to three years and are inserted under local anaesthetic into the upper arm.As these technologies leave less room for human error (such as forgetting to take one), women can relax more knowing that their contraceptive needs are taken care of. Of course, there are other implications involved in the sexual education of people, such as teaching safe sex to protect from STDs, but these easy-to-use and effective contraceptives are an empowering start for women.Any technology that not only makes girls and women’s lives easier, but that also gives them the power and confidence to be at their best each day, is pretty awesome by our standards. We aim to do this with every product that we offer women. For car, home, business and life insurance quotes that are tailor-made for your unique needs, call us today.

        "description": "",
        "content": "As the year winds down, it’s the perfect time to evaluate your insurance and get new insurance quotes on your car, home, and buildings, so you can make sure that your needs as a woman are totally covered in the coming New Year. In December, it seems natural to evaluate all areas of our lives and to look back on the year and think about what the past 12 months have brought, what you’ve achieved, what you were hoping to achieve but didn’t, and wonder how next year will be different. After all, we’re rushed day in and day out throughout the year, so December is the perfect chance to take a breath, pause, and reflect. Reflecting is good for us because it helps us embrace our accomplishments and feel good about ourselves and all that we’ve done. It can also help us decide where we want to go in the New Year, plus, taking a few moments to relax and be calm can help to ease that end-of-year stress that many of us are prone to. To help you make the most of your reflection time, we’ve got a few questions that you can ask yourself when you think about all that has happened in 2015. 1. What was my greatest accomplishment?  No matter how you feel about the year, it’s important to affirm your achievements. Your biggest accomplishment doesn’t need to be life changing – you don’t have to have climbed Mount Everest, discovered a cure for a life-threatening disease, or calculated what’s on the other side of a black hole in outer space. Think back to your proudest moment of the year and tell yourself how wonderful your achievement really is. Did the science project you helped your daughter with get the highest mark? Praise yourself for your teamwork and for raising a clever young girl! Did you excel at a difficult task at work that no one else could have done as well? Give yourself a pat on the back for your hard work and perseverance! You are worthy of your own praise, so take the time this December to remind yourself of it. 2. Did I accomplish everything I wanted to?  This question is quite open-ended because often we don’t have concrete ideas of exactly what we want to achieve. If you feel like you didn’t really conquer all the things you set out to, ask yourself why. Did you start the year with a list of written-down goals? Or was it more a vague idea of where you wanted to be at the end of 2015? It can be hard to be honest with yourself, but if you’re not where you want to be, ask why. And remember, this is not a time to blame yourself for not achieving enough. Rather, it’s a time to figure out what has been holding you back and form a tangible plan for how you will overcome these obstacles in the next year so that you can get to where you want to be. 3. What has motivated me the most?  Each day you get out of bed and you get on with your day. You go to work, or make the kids’ school lunches, or you’re active in the community, or you study hard. Whatever you do, there is something that motivates you to do it. Is it the prospect of a promotion? Or making sure your children are happy and balanced? Perhaps it’s to improve your mind and body. Figuring out what motivates you is important because it indicates what makes you happy. If doing these things didn’t bring some kind of reward, you wouldn’t do them. And when you figure out what makes you happy, you can figure out ways to do more of those inspiring things so that you can improve your quality of life. 4. How have I grown this year?  How you answer this depends entirely on what you think of as growth and success, and the wonderful thing is that there is no right answer. If your idea of growth is to become wealthier, or to advance your career, or to kick a bad habit, you’re right. And before you wonder, “Have I grown this year?” tell yourself that you are not exactly the same person as you were a year ago; you’re older and wiser. So how have you grown? However you’ve developed as a person, it’s worth giving yourself a high five, because if you’re going forward, you’re doing something right. Embrace your growth, however big or small, and love yourself for it! 5. How have I helped others?  One of the best ways to evaluate where you are in the world is to figure out what you’re doing for the world. Helping others, whether with time or money, is a sure way to feel good about yourself and know that you’ve done something worthwhile. Anne Frank was right when she wrote, “No one has ever become poor by giving.” Reflection is a time for affirming your worth and deciding where you want your life to lead in the coming days. We hope that these questions will help you see just how far you’ve come this year and how you can achieve even more in 2016. We wish you a peaceful end to the year and we look forward to seeing all of the inspiring things you’ll be doing next year!"

        "content": "The holidays are drawing closer and we’re looking forward to the release of a contented sigh as we leave work for the last time in 2015 and get ready for a relaxing, much-needed vacation. But aside from getting up to date on all your work before you go away, there are a few other bits and pieces that you’ll need to sort out before you can enjoy your vacation to the fullest; you might want to organise a reliable person to house-sit for you, especially if you have pets, and it’s a good idea to make sure that your buildings and household insurance is up to date in case something happens if you aren’t going to be at home. And, if you do go on vacation, you’ll want to make sure your portable possessions are secure, especially if you’re going to a foreign country. The end of the year shouldn’t be spent worrying about security, though. It is a time for family lunches, languid walks on the beach, and taking a deep breath to reflect on what you’ve accomplished in the year, as well as for looking forward to new beginnings in 2016. That’s why we’ve put together a list of some of the ways you can make sure that your home is safe and your valuables remain securely in your possession this festive season. Your home  There is so much to remember to take care of that you could be halfway to your destination before you realise that you forgot to take the perishable food out of your fridge! But that won’t happen with this handy checklist: Roof maintenance: With the drought affecting us across South Africa, the air is hot and dry, and this can cause your roof to crack and decay. To make things worse, when the hail storms eventually arrive, your already-perished roof may not be able to withstand the impact of the hail. Doing a little maintenance means you can go away knowing that your roof will withstand the weather and you can enjoy a stress-free break.Alarms: It’s a good idea to test your home’s alarm system from time to time to make sure it’s working. It’s also important to ensure that it has a battery backup so that if a power failure occurs, your house won’t be vulnerable to criminal attacks.Check your household insurance policy before you go to make sure you’re covered for theft and damage from natural causes such as flooding and fire.Remember that crime levels increase in South Africa over the festive season, but with a few clever tips and tricks, your valuables should be safe:If you receive mail at home, ask a neighbour to collect it so that it isn’t obvious that no one is home.Don’t leave a spare key under the flower pot by the front door, in the housing of the intercom, or any other public place that just anyone could access. Rather leave it with a trustworthy neighbour or family member, and tell anyone who may need to visit the house where to get the key.If your house is broken into, there are ways to hide valuables in plain sight. Cutting out the pages of a book to store jewellery can be a great way to stop criminals from stealing your valuables. Here are some seriously creative ideas for hiding your possessions in plain sight.Your CarIf you’re driving somewhere this December, make sure to get a full check-up for your car; it is just as susceptible to damage from the drought as your roof is. Fluids can dry up if the vehicle isn’t serviced properly, air inside your tyres can expand which could lead to a flat, and your engine can overheat.Make sure your tyres have tread before you head out; when it eventually rains, smooth tyres and wet roads can be a disastrous combination.Keep your 1st for Women towline number handy, so that should something happen on your way to your destination, our Guardian Angels can save the day and have you back to your vacation in no time. You can call them on 0860 10 42 12.Protect your portable possessions  Now that you’ve made sure your home and car are going to be OK, it’s time to enjoy that holiday! But remember, whether you’re in a foreign country or you’ve just gone across provinces, you’ll need to keep an eye on your portable possessions. Here are some tips for making sure you don’t lose your cell phone or other valuables while you’re chilling at the beach or other public areas:For moms, you can hide your phone and sunglasses in a rolled up nappy; criminals are not likely to go digging through that!Hide possessions in an empty sunscreen containerWho doesn’t love to play ball games at the beach? Take an extra tennis ball and cut an opening in it; you can store your car keys in plain sight.If you’re looking for comprehensive buildings or household insurance quotes to protect your home and your valuables these holidays, we offer tailor-made insurance for women that offers real value and helps you to make the most of your well-deserved break."

        "content": "It’s almost that time of the year, when offices are grinding to a halt as the busy year comes to an end. For many, this period also signifies the start of office Christmas party season, as companies will be splurging on elaborate celebrations filled with all-you-can-eat buffets and other treats for their employees. Many people will also be attending events hosted by family and friends to celebrate and spend time together after a long and stressful year. While it’s the time for having fun, all of these year-end parties present concerns that you’ll need to take into account; you might be nervous about hosting a big family lunch and catering for everyone, or you may need to be careful about how much alcohol you consume at your office function. If you’re wondering how to tackle these issues and stay safe at all these joyous occasions, continue reading as we have some great tips for you. When you’re hosting a party: When hosting people at your house, remember the first rule is to be present. Although you have to run around co-ordinating the evening, your guests are there for you, so the more you can get done prior to the event, the more time you can spend with guests.Mix and mingle with everyone at the party to avoid people feeling like they are not wanted; spend some time with all your guests by moving from one group to another so that you can catch up with everyone.Make sure you cater for your guests’ needs. To make everyone feel welcome, find out if they have any specific dietary requirements. Plus this will help when it comes to planning your menu as well as help you and your guests avoid feeling awkward.To ensure that nothing gets damaged during the course of the evening, consider locking up valuable and decorative items that might get damaged. But just to be safe, this is the perfect time to get home contents insurance quotes or to update your existing policy and specify any items you might have left out.Keep your pets locked up as not all guests might be animal lovers, and your pets might be overwhelmed by so many new people in your home. But do remember to give them toys to keep them occupied.Ensure that you have enough safe parking to keep your guests’ vehicles protected; this will give them and you peace of mind.When attending a party:If you are attending a party, always make it a point to notify a loved one or friend of your whereabouts so that someone knows where you are at all times.If the evening ends late and you are worried about driving on your own, get a friend to call you once you reach your destination, just to make sure you are safe. 1st for Women Insurance offers a Trip Monitor benefit, where we will call you every half an hour to ensure you reach your destination safely.Never leave your drinks unattended. Get a friend you trust to watch your drink if you must go to the bathroom or would like to answer a call.If you are going to be drinking, remember to organise a taxi to get you home. 1st for Women Insurance has an optional Designated Driver service for our customers to make sure they stay safe when they’re out.Attending an office party:Remember that office parties, no matter how informal, still remain a business event, so be sure to be on your best behaviour. This means not drinking too much of the free alcohol as your bosses and managers are watching.If you are invited to an office party, it’s important to do your best to attend because saying no could damage your reputation with your employer. And, when you attend, spend more than 30 minutes there.Have a good time! The entertainment has been paid for by the company and they like to know that their employees had a splendid time.Avoid spending the evening hogging your boss or manager with business-related talk. It is a party and your boss likely wants to relax and enjoy the evening as much as you do.End-of-year parties are for having fun! But remember to keep your safety in mind at all times. Consider how you’re going to get home, how your actions will affect your professional reputation, and if your guests are safe at your own party. 1st for Women is different from other insurance companies because we offer a number of tailor-made benefits specifically for women. When you’re out having fun this festive season, you don’t need to worry about getting home safely, breaking down on the side of the road, losing a precious possession at a party in your home, or letting your loved ones know where you are; our Designated Driver, Guardian Angels, Home Contents Insurance, and Trip Monitor services and benefits will support you so that you can fully enjoy these well-deserved celebrations and be your best self right up to the end of the year."

        "content": "September is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month and, as many of our clients know, the 1st for Women Foundation supports two projects that have focused on screening, vaccinating and educating people on cervical cancer in South Africa since 2010: the HPV Cervical Cancer Research Fund (HCCRF) and Right to Care. Cervical cancer is caused by the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). While there are multiple types of this virus, types 16 and 18 are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers. In South Africa, cervical cancer is typically a disease of poverty as many women have no access to screening and treatment. It is also the most common cancer in women between the ages of 15- and 44-years-old in South Africa – incredibly, 1 in 35 of our country’s women is diagnosed with this disease in her lifetime. Similarly, more than 3400 women in SA die of cervical cancer every year and it is the fourth leading cause of death among South Africans. It is estimated that around 21% of women in the general South African population harbour cervical HPV infection at any given time. This statistic reveals the need to encourage early screening and treatment to manage this preventable and treatable disease, and to empower women with the education to take care of their own health. Over the past few years, HCCRF has undertaken a project to find out whether vaccination programmes in primary schools across the country are feasible in terms of cost and delivery. This project, called the Vaccine and Cervical Cancer Screen (VACCS) project, was undertaken in Gauteng and Western Cape schools. Nine primary schools in Cape Town and 10 schools in Tshwane Metropolitan City were chosen for the project, which focused on girls in grades four to seven, aged nine and up. Mothers of school students were also invited to participate. This project was approved by the provincial and national Departments of Education, as well as the national Department of Health. The 1st for Women Foundation provided investigator support, much-needed funding, and supported the screening and treatment of screen-positive women for this project, which we hope will lead to new beginnings for young school girls and their mothers at risk of cervical cancer. Following the project, the HCCRF was tasked with presenting its findings to relevant advisory committees and the results had a considerable impact on current national policy. Despite challenges such as maintaining the cold chain for vaccines, educating parents and students on the benefits of receiving the vaccine, and obtaining permission from parents, the project demonstrated to government that a programme like this is feasible for primary schools, and helped to convince the Ministry of Finance to provide funding for the project. The 1st for Women Foundation is proud to fund this wonderful initiative that puts the healthcare of girls and women into their own hands, empowering them to take care of themselves. By preventing and treating this disease, South African girls and women face a new beginning in their lives."

        "heading": "Spring clean your life ",
        "description": "",
        "content": "Many of us go through the routine of spring cleaning our homes every year, but how many of us ever spring clean our lives? We all know what it’s like to be stuck in a rut, whether it’s at work, in a relationship, or even a financial rut. At 1st for Women, we believe that, every now and then, women should be empowered to spring clean their lives by sweeping away the bad relationships, polishing up their finances (even if it’s just getting a new quote on their insurance) and dusting off their CVs to find a new job. To inspire you to be the best woman you can be, we put together a few reasons to re-examine four important areas of your life that might benefit from a little tidying up: Your relationships Whether it’s happened to you when you were a youngster at school, a student in college, or an adult at work, you have probably been in a relationship with at least one person who was toxic for you. But did you know these kinds of relationships can adversely affect your health? Women who are in stressful romantic relationships or marriages may be more likely to suffer a range of health issues, including heart problems (compared to women who don’t have marital stress), poor mental health, a lowered immune system, and more. But don’t think that a bad friendship can’t be just as damaging. You might have been buddies with someone for many years, but that doesn’t mean your friendship isn’t hurting you. Here are some signs that it might be time to re-evaluate a friendship:You fight all the timeShe can’t resolve a problem without youYour relationship blows hot and cold – it’s great one day then awful the nextMaking the decision to leave a toxic relationship can bring a weight of guilt with it, but chances are, if it’s bad for you, it’s bad for the other person too, and calling it quits can be best for both of you. Your finances There are some financial commitments that cannot be adjusted, like your child’s school fees. But there are just many that you can change, such as your insurance premiums. We know how stressful and crazy modern life is, which is why we offer several products including vehicle, life, business and buildings insurance. Having all of this with a single insurer helps to make your finances easier to manage. Plus, with us, you’ll receive an insurance package and quote that is tailor-made just for you. Your work Work means different things for different women. For some, it’s a means to an end. A regular pay cheque brings the ability to go out with friends on the weekend or to take the kids on holiday at the end of the year. For others, it’s the most fulfilling aspect of their lives. But whether you work purely out of necessity or you absolutely love what you do, your working environment should make you happy. If it doesn’t, it might be time to send your CV out into the world, especially if you find any of these familiar:The thought of going to work puts your stomach in knotsYou don’t feel respectedYou don’t have passion for your work anymoreYour values don’t align with the company’sYou feel your talents are not being used properlyMost of us spend more time at work than anywhere else. If the environment or people are making you miserable, look for a company that values the unique skills you have to offer. Your clothes Spring cleaning your wardrobe can be a little daunting, particularly if you haven’t done it in a while, but there are several reasons to sort it out this spring. Firstly, you’ll make space for new clothes, and who doesn’t want that! Secondly, it turns out that decluttering is good for your mental well-being. A study conducted by UCLA’s Center on Everyday Lives and Families (CELF) found that there is a link between clutter, and depression and self-esteem. Thirdly, if you clear out your closet, you could make yourself a tidy sum if you sell your clothes. However, if you don’t sell them and choose to rather give them away, you’ll be doing a good deed for someone who needs them, and that could give someone else a new beginning, too."

        "content": "It takes a whole lot of courage to be a mom in the modern world. Once you have a child, you’ve dedicated yourself to a life of uplifting another human being, no matter what age your child is. You feed and hold them as babies; you work hard to provide them with an education when they’re growing up, you hug them through their first heart breaks, you take out life insurance so that should something happen to you, they will be taken care of, all while giving them every ounce of love you have in your heart.It takes courage to do all of this so selflessly!On top of all this, there are the endless advice columns and magazines telling you what you should be doing as a mother. You must have a firm and fit body, the time to drive your kids to soccer practice, cook a roast every night, buy them a new PlayStation, and still work 12 hours a day.At 1st for Women, we don’t think any of these unrealistically high expectations make a good mother. To us, it’s about giving your child your best within your own personal situation and passing on your values. Find out more below:  ValuesEach person is different – what is important to one is not so important to another. No matter what other people think, a good mom will try her best to pass her values onto her children, whether this is kindness to others, pride in appearance, politeness, or a love of animals.GrowthEveryone makes mistakes – it’s a part of life. Making mistakes isn’t what matters; it’s how we grow from them that does. There is nothing wrong with making a mistake with our kids, because we can turn that into an opportunity to teach them how to grow from these slipups.Self-worthKids have it hard, too. They deal with bullies teasing them and teachers judging their work all day long. But through encouragement and small gestures like a pat on the back (even when they have failed), you can raise a child that knows their own self-worth.LoveWe left the most important point for last. Loving your children is the best gift you can give them. Taking out life insurance, tucking them in bed at night, holding their hands while you lead them into their first day at nursery school, and even asking, “How was your day?” are all the ways we show our children that we love them, and if you love your kids, you’re doing parenting right!Remember that no one realistically expects you to be the ‘perfect’ mom all the time. Indeed, there is no such thing. We all have good and bad days, and that’s OK. Being the best mom you can be means doing your best within your own personal circumstances and having the courage to accept that you are not perfect!1st for Women wants you to be the best mom you can be, which is why we offer helpful benefits such as our Guardian Angels, Home Assist, Medical Assist, Nurse @ First, and Concierge Assist to help you when you need it most."

        "description": "",
        "content": "“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by those you did.” Mark TwainIf anything, we would all like to be recognised for doing excellent work and be rewarded for it. However, sometimes being noticed is difficult as the working world is becoming more and more competitive. Having courage at work is beneficial for numerous reasons. It allows you to build self-confidence as well as motivates you to take calculated risks. It also gives you an opportunity to form relationships with your colleagues and clients and, most importantly, it allows you to have good rapport with your manager and boss, who are, after all, the ones that determine how fast you will climb the corporate ladder within your organisation. If you feel like you don’t have the confidence to be as courageous and bold as you can at the workplace, here are a few tips to improve your confidence levels:Follow your resolveThis is easier said than done. You may start the day with a clear plan of action on how you wish to tackle whatever tasks come your way. Over the course of the day, you may get side-tracked and forget these. Make it a point to have a clear idea in your mind of what you would like to accomplish and make sure that by the end of the day, week or month you have achieved that.Remember to ask questionsThose who seem interested in whatever they are doing are more likely to succeed. Next time, you’re in meetings or in discussions, make sure to ask as many questions as possible – however, make sure you are asking relevant questions.Be brief and to the point The workplace is made up of many different people from various backgrounds with different personalities; some people might not like speaking up at all, while others might enjoy talking a lot. If you happen to fall in the latter, it’s a good idea to remember that in meetings you should aim to keep your points brief and to the point; no one likes listening to a long and drawn out conversation with no end or no clear direction at all, especially as people have deadlines looming.Go the extra mileThere are two types of employees — those who wait to be told what to do and those who take initiative and find ways to be productive for the benefit of their company. By taking initiative to carry out tasks that you weren’t asked to, shows that you not only enjoy your job but you are worth keeping around. This also demonstrates your diversity and ability to interchange between different roles within the workplace.Be flexible, have the ability to work with othersBeing able to work well with others in a team is a huge credit to your profile as an employee. It portrays the ability to cope well with different personalities, which is a huge factor when it comes to being promoted to a more senior or managerial position.Be a team player; suggest other, better waysWorking in a team requires tact, as people are different.. Ensure that everyone’s opinion is heard and respected. If you don’t agree with a point that’s raised, speak out and suggest a better alternative.Insist on getting feedback to guide your actionsDoing  something without  receiving positive feedback can get to anyone. If you would like to progress, you have to be brave and ask questions. Although it might seem daunting, it’s always good to ask where  you can improve. In an interview situation you might perhaps be mumbling your responses, which make you look self-conscious or are avoiding eye contact when speaking which makes interviewers feel like they can’t trust you. If you know, it’s easy to fix the little mistakes.Take initiativeIt is good to make things happen. This can be doing whatever is required of you before  you’re even asked for it,  such as organising meetings, getting paper for the printing machine or coming up with suggestions on how to make the business work better.  Stand up for your convictions and points of viewYour organisation might be involved in unethical activities that you don’t agree with and they might expect you as an employee to become involved. What do you do? This is the time that you need to bring your courage into play and to stand up for what you believe in. It might cost you a promotion or your position, but it will make you feel a lot prouder, knowing that you stood up for what you know is right.Being courageous can get you farther in the workplace. It can also push you into looking at other opportunities for improvement and growth, such as opening your own business, which is as bold as you can get. If you decide to venture into the business front, consider taking out business insurance that will look after your business interests. 1st for Women business insurance policies are just the right type of insurance you need as they are tailored to suit a variety of businesses."

        "content": "Since August is women’s month, it is fitting that some amazing South African women who are doing great things in and around their communities are showcased, not only for the benefit of women, but for the community at large.Many of these women come from everyday backgrounds and have started their careers from the ground up, persevering and working hard to be where they are today:Jane Raphaely To many she is the powerful MD of Associated Magazines, the publishing doyenne of South Africa’s top magazines. Originally from the United Kingdom, Jane won a Rotary Fellowship scholarship to pursue her studies at Columbia State University in upstate New York.  Immediately after she immigrated to South Africa in 1960, and started her career in Advertising and PR. While working, Jane got an opportunity to become the editor of Fair Lady Magazine - the first women titled English magazine at the time.  She made a success of it and went on to open her very own publishing company – Jane Raphealy and Associates, with her husband, Michael Raphaely, and business partner, Volker Kühnel. Together they brought the popular American title, Cosmopolitan to South African shores and the rest as they say, is history.Khanyi Dhlomo Starting her career at the tender age of 20, as a newsreader for the SABC, Khanyi Dhlomo has had a lot of doors that have opened up for her. She has worked tirelessly to add to her success. After her stint as a newsreader, she took up a position at True Love Magazine as an assistant fashion and beauty stylist. She worked endlessly to ensure that her bosses took note and when her boss quit to move to France, she was appointed editor.  Khanyi headed up the magazine for eight years.

This included serious crimes (murders, sexual offences and rape), assaults with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, car jackings, robberies at residential premises, property-related crimes, burglaries, and theft of motor vehicles.\nTaking these data points into account, the province scoring the highest overall safety score is Limpopo, which emerged as the province where the female population felt the safest. They boast consistently high safety scores across all categories and reported the lowest number of annual crimes, including assault and murder.\nWhile the NorthernCape and North West exhibit some areas of concern, with high crime figures forspecific categories of &lsquo;Reported theft of motor vehicles&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reportedburglaries,&rsquo; both provinces scored very well in the overall category of&lsquo;Feeling safe in the province.&rsquo; However, the EasternCape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Free State showed mixed safety performances across all categories. Gauteng follows closely behind, with most respondents feelingunsafe, especially in the &lsquo;Walking alone at night&rsquo; category.

        "content": " - Which type of Commercial Vehicle Insurance is best? - The best type of Commercial Vehicle Insurance depends on the specific needs of your business. Various options include Comprehensive, Third-Party, Third-Party Fire and Theft, and even specialised coverage for different industries. The best choice for you and your business should align with your business size, industry, and risk factors. Speak to one of our experts today who can tailor your policy to your unique needs for maximum protection. - How does Business Car Insurance work? - Business Car Insurance provides coverage for vehicles used for business purposes. Coverage is tailored based on the nature of your business, and premiums are determined based on factors like vehicle type, usage and coverage levels. In case of accidents, the insurance pays for repairs or replacement of the vehicle, medical expenses, and liability claims if you or your employees are at fault. A policy offers more liability coverage than a personal Car Insurance policy. - How much do you pay for Business Car Insurance? - The cost varies widely based on several factors, including the type of coverage chosen, the nature of your business, the number of vehicles, their value, the driving records of employees, and your business location. Requesting a Business Car Insurance quote is essential to determine the exact cost, as rates are highly individualised. - Why do you need Commercial Vehicle Insurance? - It is essential for many reasons. It provides financial protection in case of accidents or damage to business-owned vehicles, ensuring that repair or replacement costs don\"t cripple your day-to-day operations. Additionally, Commercial Car Insurance covers liability claims, protecting your business assets from third-party claims. It\"s a safeguard for your vehicles and a critical part of responsible business management."

        "description": "",
        "content": "As the year\"s end rapidly approaches, you may go on holiday or take it easy at home. Whether you plan to use the time to unwind or catch up on household tasks, it\"s an ideal time to evaluate how well you\"re protecting your home and determine if your current home security and insurance cover adequately address your needs. You may have a home security system or House Contents Insurance from 1st for Women, but not both. Discover why the two are linked and how this reciprocal relationship can provide extra protection for your home. The link between home security and Contents InsuranceAccording to the South African Police Service\"s crime statistics for 2023\"s second quarter, the number of reported home burglaries has declined compared to the same period the previous year. Despite this, home burglaries remain a challenge for homeowners and remain the biggest crime subcategory in the country.In many cases, having a visible and reactive home security system is enough to put off opportunistic criminals wanting to try their luck at breaking into your home. For more persistent criminals, its rapid response to your home\"s triggered alarm leaves them little time to sweep your home for valuables. Security and surveillance technology advances also mean you can remotely control who accesses your home and view your property\"s cameras via your phone, even if you\"re hundreds of kilometres away.Unfortunately, this doesn\"t mean you\"re guaranteed never to experience any losses. It\"s a reality that as home security systems have gotten smarter, so have criminals. Even if you have a cutting-edge home security system and armed response service, there is still a chance that a criminal could steal from you. Insurers and security companies alike often recommend homeowners invest in a home security system and Household Contents Insurance.You may even find that having a home security system in place results in lower monthly premiums for your Contents Insurance as it reduces your risk factor. This means you\"re less likely to be robbed because you&rsquo;ve taken proactive measures to prevent this.Assessing your needs: how much Contents Insurance do you need?To get the best Contents Insurance coverage for your needs, you should begin by thoroughly and accurately assessing your coverage needs by following these steps:1. Evaluate your risk factorsResearch your location, the type of home you live in and your choice of home security system, as this will impact the likelihood of someone robbing you. For example, your neighbourhood may have experienced higher-than-average break-ins over the past year, increasing your risk. You may only have a security system for your outer property but not your actual home, requiring you to upgrade. If you live in a gated estate or complex, you may have on-site security guards, lowering your risk compared to a freestanding property.2. Evaluate your possessionsTo ensure you choose a coverage level that will recover your losses, it&rsquo;s highly advisable that you should maintain an updated list of your insured possessions and their market or retail value. This could require you to get a third-party appraisal of an item\"s value, and rare or costly items may require their own dedicated insurance.3. Be realistic but fairIt\"s recommended that you insure any item that would be costly to replace and take a worst-case-scenario approach to what you insure. That said, overinsuring an item or being misleading in your coverage can result in your insurance claim being rejected.4. Stay up to dateElectronics and technology items can decrease in value over time and become obsolete. When insuring these items, take into account if you\"ll want a model upgrade later on or what features you\"ll want in a suitable replacement. It\"s also important to note if you replace items with a newer model, upgrade it for a more expensive one or do away with it altogether.Home security tips from the insurance expertsTo optimise your home security towards a more favourable insurance premium or favourable insurance claim, check that you meet the following requirements:Attend to any faults or errors in your home security system and entry points to your home the moment you notice them. You could have a claim rejected if it\"s determined you ignored an alarm fault that allowed a criminal to enter your home or if you didn\"t immediately fix a broken window that was used to gain entry to your home. Create anti-theft deterrents. Make sure you lock every entry point when you leave your home and keep valuables out of sight&mdash;whether you\"re popping down to the shops or going away for a month-long break. Ensuring that your home is well-lit with outside security lighting is equally important. Take a proactive approach to your home\"s safety by getting involved in any local community watch or crime watch groups.How to claim for theft on insuranceYou\"ve invested in insurance and a home security system. Unfortunately, you could still get robbed. That&rsquo;s what insurance is for, so follow these steps to recover your losses as quickly and efficiently as possible:If you suspect your home\"s been broken into before entering it, contact the police or neighbourhood watch before attempting to enter. Your safety and that of your family come first.Once your home is safe to enter and you\"ve reported the theft to the police and obtained a report or case number, create a document detailing what\"s been stolen, damaged, or destroyed.Compile any additional documents (such as appraisal documents or proof of payments) and contact your insurer. They\"ll likely take these documents and assign an assessor or insurance adjustor to your case.The better prepared you are, the quicker you can expect your claim to be processed. Once it is, make sure you review the settlement and are happy with it before accepting it and using the payout to replace any broken, damaged, or stolen items.Get a Home Contents Insurance quote from 1st for WomenNow that you\"re aware of the benefits of having both Contents Insurance and home security, you can relax and go on a holiday with more peace of mind.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Have you ever worried about whether your high-value household items are covered by Home Contents Insurance? If you have any jewellery, expensive electronics or artwork, for example, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place for expert advice and guidance. Home Contents Insurance from 1st for Women is the solution to protect your expensive possessions against theft, damages and losses. Discover more about how to go about insuring your high-value items.Why Home Contents Insurance is suitable for your high-value itemsProtecting high-value household items against unexpected loss or damage can be achieved with a Home Contents Insurance policy. It is important, however, to be aware that some standard policies come with coverage limits, including items such as jewellery, electronics, and art. Therefore, it&rsquo;s necessary to specify these items in the policy. This will ensure that any replacement or repairs of these goods will be adequately covered by insurance, giving you the reassurance that you need.To protect valuables such as jewellery, works of art or electronic devices, make sure that you specify them in your policy and provide receipts or appraisals for proof of value. In addition, you may have to show that they have been in safe storage if their value is over a certain amount. It&rsquo;s also advisable to review your policy regularly in case you need to make any revisions so it aligns with the current value of your assets, ensuring any replacement or repair without having to pay huge sums in out-of-pocket expenses. This level of attention and management of your policy ensures that your Home Contents Insurance covers you and your valuables.Make sure you\"ve specified high-value items under Home Contents CoverMake sure that your items will be adequately covered by evaluating their value and following the recommended steps (given below) to specify them on your policy. Let&rsquo;s use a piece of art to illustrate the best way to ensure cover for a high-value item. Zinzi recently bought a sculpture by a renowned South African sculptor. Being a careful person, Zinzi already had Home Contents Insurance in place. However, when she checked the cover limit on her policy, she saw that it was far less than the amount she&rsquo;d paid for her new artwork. She took a copy of the professional appraisal, the receipt, and a few photos of the art and consulted her insurer on how best to protect her new acquisition. By specifying her new sculpture and an appropriate coverage amount in her policy, Zinzi now has appropriate coverage and peace of mind. Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step outline of the process that Zini followed: 1. Review your policy: Review your current policy thoroughly. Make sure you understand what is covered when it comes to personal property, including any conditions. It is important to know that many standard policies limit specific values for certain items.2. Appraisal of high-value items: For objects such as art, jewellery, antiques, and collectables, it is recommended to take them for a professional appraisal. This allows for a precise valuation of the item to establish the necessary insurance coverage.3. Document the items: Make a list of all valuable items that need to be covered. This list should describe them in detail and include any pictures, invoices, or other documents that verify the existence and value of the items. This evidence is important if you ever need to make a claim.4. Contact your insurer: Contact your insurance provider so that they are aware that you want to insure a high-value item. You may need to complete certain documentation to make additions to your insurance policy. You may also be expected to show appraisal information that you have collected.5. Specify the coverage amount: Work with your insurance company to establish the ideal coverage amount per each high-value item. Providing appraisal or valuation data may be part of this approach. As such, make sure the coverage amount can cater for replacing the item due to loss, damage, or theft. According to a recent BusinessTech article, homeowners saw a 40% increase in the number of burglaries in the first two weeks of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, highlighting the importance of having contents coverage in place to protect your property against any eventuality.6. Review and adjust: Review your policy periodically, and where necessary, update it. Additionally, you should make sure that you change your coverage whenever there is a change in value for your items and with every new purchase of high-priced goods.7. Keep records updated: Make sure you maintain accurate and up-to-date records. You must communicate with your insurance provider about any changes you might make to the collection, such as adding new items. By taking a proactive approach, you can make sure that all your property is well covered and its value fully compensated.Types of high-value household items to specifyHousehold items that are high-value, such as jewellery, paintings, electronics, antiques and other collectables, might have a value that exceeds the limits of cover contained in a general Home Contents Insurance policy. It is highly recommended to insure them individually so that if they are lost, stolen or damaged, you can be adequately compensated. This includes:Jewellery: including engagement rings, inherited pieces of jewellery, expensive necklaces, watches and other valuables.Art and collectables: like paintings, sculptures and rare books.Electronics: plasma TVs, top-of-the-range audio/video equipment, cameras, and home theatre systems.Antiques: vintage furniture, china, or other antique items.Musical instruments: upmarket guitars, drums, violins and other instruments.Silverware and fine china: silverware sets, fine china and crystal.Wine collections: rare or expensive wine collections.Designer clothing and accessories: including high-end fashion products, such as luxury clothes, handbags, and shoes.Sports equipment: such as golf clubs and bicycles.Home office equipment: computers, printers and other office electronic devices.When should a household item be insured separately from Home Contents?Sometimes household items need to be covered completely separately due to coverage limits. Most standard policies specify maximum coverage amounts for personal property; however, this may be inadequate to match the full value of a particular item. As a result, these items should be insured individually to have them covered properly and at the correct value.When the value of possessions exceeds a policy\"s limit, the importance of individual insurance becomes more significant. It should be noted that standard coverage may not provide the full amount needed to replace or restore these items in case of loss or damage. For example, this may mean that a normal policy will have a maximum cover for jewellery, falling short of covering the value of an item such as an engagement ring. Tailored coverage, commonly known as &ldquo;endorsements&rdquo;, is used to ensure individualised coverage of each item.Insurers may also require documents, like the appraisal or receipt, for proof of the value of the item to ensure that the insurance is proportional to the worth of the goods. For example, when an engagement ring exceeds the standard policy limit, it will need supplemental or separate coverage. This will bridge the gap on normal coverage while also customising protection based on the asset\"s actual value &ndash; giving you peace of mind that such an expensive and sentimental possession is adequately covered.Get a Home Contents Insurance quote from 1st for WomenAre you ready to safeguard your prized possessions?

        "content": "As a business offering clients professional advice, you know that there&rsquo;s no room for error. You evaluate each project or person&rsquo;s case and apply for professional skillset in order to provide them with the best advice possible. This means that while each job brings a new challenge, it also holds the possibility of making a mistake.  Errors and Omissions Insurance is a form of Business Liability Insurance that protects companies or individuals offering advisory or consulting services. Discover more about this specialised form of Liability Insurance, including who needs it and what sort of business risk it covers. What is Errors and Omissions Insurance?Errors and Omissions covers any professional services provider offering clients advice in exchange for a fee, like accounting services, financial or legal advice. It protects your professional reputation and your business stability against the cost or payout of a lawsuit, any legal defence required and any settlement or judgment outcomes. E&amp;O Insurance covers claims concerning allegations of inadequate, negligent, inaccurate or incomplete advice that leads to a client experiencing losses or damage. Difference between Errors and Omissions &amp; Professional Indemnity InsuranceYou may be wondering how Professional Indemnity Insurance differs from Errors and Omissions coverage. The main difference between the two is different terminologies and industry applications. Who needs Errors and Omissions Insurance?E&amp;O Insurance covers a range of vocations and industries that offer educated or skilled advice in exchange for a fee. This includes traditional roles like tax advisors, auditors, engineers, and other areas of operation. For example, IT professionals and real estate agents are in the business of advising clients on decisions that can be worth hundreds of thousands of rands and could benefit from this &mdash; as could project managers and event planners.What Errors and Omissions Insurance coversIn most cases, E&amp;O Insurance will cover the legal defence costs and any resulting settlements, compensation or judgements you\"re required to pay should your business be found liable. While your coverage will depend on the nature of services you offer, here are some other specific incidences of how Errors and Omissions Insurance can protect you against:Cyber liability and data breach or infringement claims &mdash; Businesses can be vulnerable to litigation over a client\"s losses and damages resulting from criminals accessing their private information. This can involve criminals accessing your business\"s network and client information stored on it for use in financial fraud or identity theft. It can also involve competitors accessing trademarked or copyright-protected information.Professional negligence &mdash; This covers you if it\"s determined that you failed to exercise reasonable care and diligence when advising a client, considering what\"s typically expected from someone with your expertise or skills. It can also cover you if you took on a mandate without having the skills or experience to manage it or made a reasonable professional error in judgement. Practical examples of Omissions and Errors in businessTake a look at these two examples:1. Leslie is an estate agent and is approached by someone wanting to sell a family farmhouse that\"s been uninhabited for years. A couple buy the home and realise that it isn\"t connected to a municipal water supply, forcing them to buy water for drinking and cooking. The new owners open a formal legal case against the estate agent for failing to disclose this &mdash; requesting they cover the cost of connecting the property to the system. Leslie will be deemed responsible for this cost if she is found to have been negligent by not ascertaining this information from the original owners. 2. Manny is an event planner and plans a cartoon character-themed party for a celebrity\"s child. The party is profiled by the media, where the cartoon character\"s creators see it and sue Manny for failing to secure permission to use their copyright branding. As the celebrity client had given Manny a budget and allowed him to select the theme, the celebrity and cartoon character both make claims against Manny &mdash; the celebrity for the resulting negative publicity that lost her a contract and the creators for the fee they\"d typically charge for using their branding in a high-profile setting. Manny could be found liable for both counts as he failed to undertake appropriate due diligence in conducting proper checks and research about the copyright. How much E&amp;O Insurance do you need? The level of coverage you get (and the value of claims you\"re covered for) will depend on the following factors:Your risk factors &mdash; This will consider whether or not your industry is high risk or you\"ve faced similar claims before. Coverage limits &mdash; The average payouts businesses make in similar cases.Business type &mdash; If you deal with large clients and high-value projects, you\"ll require correspondingly high coverage. Terms and conditions &mdash; You may need to pay deductibles and premiums to access full claim coverage. Insurers can also exclude specific claims or have an annual claims limit.

        "content": "Do you wear multiple hats, balancing the demands of both your professional and personal lives? Perhaps you\"re a homeowner, a vehicle owner, or a business owner. In today\"s multifaceted world, where decisions affect not only our families but also our careers and investments, ensuring protection is paramount. That\"s why 1st for Women wants to address a crucial aspect of safeguarding your interests - Directors and Officers Insurance. Whether you\"re a director, officer, or involved in business leadership in any capacity, this type of Business Insurance is tailored to protect you and your organisation from the complex challenges of leadership liability. Let\"s explore why every board, including yours, needs Directors Liability Insurance.What is meant by Directors and Officers?It&rsquo;s common to refer to the central leaders of a company or group as Directors and Officers, or D&amp;O. The Board of Directors comprises key members who make strategic judgements and implement corporate governance. Officers such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Finance Officer (CFO), and Chief Operation Officer (COO) are responsible for running the company. These influential individuals take on a multitude of critical duties, including which path to take for the company and carry a fiduciary obligation to serve the group\"s interests.What is Directors and Officers Insurance?Directors Liability Insurance (D&amp;O) is a specialised form of Business Liability Insurance designed to safeguard the organisation and the individuals serving as officers and directors. This policy provides coverage for financial losses and legal expenses that may arise from acts of mismanagement or breach of fiduciary duty, among other leadership-related liabilities. It serves as a critical shield for the personal assets of corporate leaders, empowering them to make important decisions without worrying about personal financial ruin in the event of legal actions or allegations.Difference between Professional Indemnity &amp; Directors and Officers InsuranceCorporate executives and professionals alike need to understand the differences between Directors and Officers Insurance (D&amp;O) and Professional Indemnity Insurance (PII).  One of the key benefits of D&amp;O is protection against litigation due to fiduciary breaches and mismanagement, as it covers both the company and its leaders. Meanwhile, PII is specifically tailored to the needs of professionals, like lawyers and accountants, seeking coverage against alleged errors, omissions, and negligence in their consulting and advisory work. Essentially, D&amp;O offers coverage for the leadership, whereas PII focuses on individual liability.Why does a company need Directors and Officers Insurance?Directors and Officers Insurance is a critical safeguard for professionals and business leaders against the complexities ofleadership liabilities. It covers personal assets, provides legal defence, and ensures financial protection, allowing you to lead with confidence. Directors and officers can find themselves personally liable for their actions, even if the decisions they made were on behalf of the company. According to the South African Institute of Taxation, directors are becoming increasingly accountable for their actions. Courts and society are increasingly holding directors more accountable &ndash; especially when a company\"s stakeholders suffer a loss. People turn to the board of directors as the first source of accountability and recovery.D&amp;O Insurance provides vital protection for directors\" and officers&rsquo; personal assets, considering these risk factors:Varied liabilities: Corporate leaders face numerous potential liabilities, including compensation disputes, labour issues, and environmental concerns. Ignoring these risks can lead to legal action, reputational harm, and other undesirable outcomes. Staying informed about regulations and industry standards is crucial.Financial misrepresentation: Imagine if a CFO manipulated financial statements to present a dire financial situation as favourable. When shareholders uncover this, they could file a lawsuit against the entire Board of Directors and the CFO. D&amp;O Insurance protects these corporate figures, preserving their financial well-being and assets.Directors Liability Insurance benefits manifest in real-life scenarios. For instance:Fiscal mismanagement: Neglecting financial oversight can lead to unpaid bills and spiralling debt. A CFO\"s falsifying financial statements could result in a lawsuit by shareholders, accusing the Board of financial mismanagement. D&amp;O Insurance covered legal costs and settlements.Failure in compliance: If a manufacturing company and its CEO were found to be environmentally non-compliant following an investigation, which resulted in penalties and fines, D&amp;O Insurance would cover legal expenses, mitigating the fiscal consequences for both the board and CEO.What Directors and Officers Insurance coversDirectors and Officers Liability Insurance safeguards corporate leaders, covering legal expenses tied to their duties, making it an essential investment for businesses facing potential lawsuits. D&amp;O Insurance comprehensively addresses various scenarios like:Legal defence costs: It covers legal expenses like court and attorney fees, ensuring directors and officers are supported in legal disputes.Settlements and compensation: Directors and Officers Liability Insurance handles the costs of legal claims resulting in settlements or compensation payments.Personal asset protection: D&amp;O Insurance prevents individuals from tapping into personal assets, like homes and savings, to settle claims.Corporate reimbursement: It allows the corporation to receive compensation when directors and officers are indemnified.Investigation costs: This insurance covers expenses tied to regulatory or internal investigations.Breach of fiduciary duty: Here, allegations of mismanagement or failure to act in the company\"s best interest are addressed.Crisis management costs: This covers expenses for reputation management during a high-risk event or incident. Derivative actions: D&amp;O Insurance provides protection in the event of shareholders suing on the company&rsquo;s behalfSide A coverage: This insurance shields individual executives when corporate indemnification isn\"t available, ensuring personal assets remain safe.Side B coverage: It finances legal expenses and settlements for directors and officers, offering reimbursement for indemnification.Side C coverage (Entity coverage): D&amp;O Insurance directly protects the corporation, preserving its financial health against legal liabilities and claims.Get the right type of Liability Insurance for your enterprise.

        "content": "You\"ve poured blood, sweat and tears into getting your business where it is today. Now that you\"re no longer operating out of your garage and crunching numbers on your couch, you feel confident enough to step back and consider how to safeguard your recent growth. To make sure your small business survives whatever the future throws at it, you\"ll need to develop a Business Continuity Plan. Explore what this plan should include and howBusiness Insurance coverage from 1st For Women will help you succeed in your business journey. What is a Business Continuity Plan, and why is it important?Starting a business is like raising a child &mdash; no matter how many books you read and how much advice you get from others, nothing quite prepares you for the real thing. The first few years go by in a blur and if you survive this critical initial stage, you may wake up one day wondering when all this growth happened!In the same manner that parents draw up a will or purchase life cover to care for their families, business owners can create a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to help safeguard their enterprise. This will detail how your business can continue operating in the presence of certain risks, disruptions, emergencies or disasters. It\"s a useful tool for assessing your environment so you can identify possible future risks and how to handle them. The goal is to provide clear guidance on how to keep your business operational in the event of possible challenges.4 key factors that a Business Continuity Plan should address1. What risks will my business encounter in its day-to-day operations? Can I identify, understand, evaluate their impact and prioritise them?2. What is the impact of a worst-case scenario? How can I help my business recover if this should happen?3. What would I (or my next-in-command) need to do &mdash; step by step &mdash; if a crisis takes place in order to minimise loss and resume functioning as soon as possible?4. Is there any training and testing I can offer my staff and stakeholders to prepare us better for these risks?The role of Business Insurance in Business ContinuityWhile a Business Continuity Plan will outline valuable information your business can rely on in a crisis, it won\"t recover any financial damage it sustains should something interrupt your operations. This is why your plan should include Business InsuranceNatural. Mother Nature rarely warns us before she strikes, so you need coverage for damage sustained from events like floods, hailstorms and fires.Accidents and incidents. Malfunctioning or broken equipment can force a business to shut down temporarily or indefinitely.Unforeseen Events. Service delivery issues or industrial action are some instances of events that could severely impact your daily operations. Legal or regulatory changes. Legal changes can require hours of downtime and costly legal or accounting advice.Business Insurance does so much more than recover the losses of time spent not working or repairs to essential equipment. Business Interruption Insurance, for instance, minimises your losses by providing compensation for lost revenue and allows you to keep functioning with minimal disruption. Having a good Business Insurance policy will also help build stakeholder relations. Clients, suppliers and customers will be confident in the fact that you have an action plan and the means to keep operations running. Successful Business Continuity examplesHere\"s how different businesses could benefit from Business Insurance:Four years ago, Darla started baking and selling cakes from home. Today she runs a successful commercial bakery with four employees. She has created a Business Continuity Plan which includes her partnering with another bakery nearby so that if one can\"t fulfil their orders, the other will step in. Her plan highlights that with orders taken care of, the biggest impact of any disruption would be honouring her financial commitments. As her bakery is in a trendy suburb, rent is her highest cost, followed by staff salaries. She purchases a Comprehensive Small Business Insurance policy to cover all areas of identified risk. Unfortunately, Darla&rsquo;s bakery experiences a major equipment malfunction, sending her production into serious downtime. Fortunately, she is able to meet her contractual obligations by handing over orders to her partner bakery. Business Interruption Insurance, which is part of her comprehensive insurance package, compensates her for the loss of revenue and assists in paying her rent and staff salaries. In the second scenario, imagine that Erik has been running an eCommerce business for several years, and his company is considered the best place to buy affordable hy outdoor equipment. Erik invests in keeping his website secure, but unfortunately, a hacker steals his passwords, accesses his database and obtains thousands of customers\" credit card details.Erikh the incident quickly but is still forced to shut his website down temporarily. However, when he purchased Business Inspan&gt;coverage, he  added Public Liability Insurance which covers any third-party claims he may have to deal with should ad customer decide to take legal action against him for alleged negligence. Integrating continuity plans with Business InsuranceIf sure how to draw up and use a successful Business Continuity Plan, here are some pointers to guide you in the right direction:First, identify and rank your business functions, employees, purchases and expenses from most to least important so you can determine what needs coverage and what level of cover is required.Take note of any unusual aspects of your business that may require specialised insurance. Identify overlapping and dependencies between different departments and members of staff.Consider any savings you have, whether this could/would cover any costs and how long these funds would last.Imagine the worst-case scenario taking place &mdash; this will help you create plans to maintain operations, protect your employees, as well as decide which assets to keep or sell.Ensure that your insurance covers your specific risks. If you&rsquo;re unsure, speak to a trained insurance broker for clarity. Get a Business Insurance quote from 1st for WomenDon&rsquo;t resign yourself to the unexpected in business.

        "content": "Ensuring you have the right insurance cover, particularly when you\"re running a business, can be a daunting task. Business Interruption Insurance is one type of insurance that is becoming increasingly vital but is often misunderstood. As business owners, understanding this concept can mean the difference between staying afloat or sinking after an unexpected challenge. At 1st for Women, we are committed to helping women entrepreneurs navigate these challenges with confidence. Find out more about property damage in relation to your business operations.  How property damage can cause a business interruptionProperty damage &ndash; such as that caused by fires, floods or other unforeseen events &ndash; can trigger a complex cascade of interruptions in your business. Consider a scenario where a flood damages your premises. This results in the immediate loss of many physical assets and disrupts your normal operations, leading to a temporary or prolonged shutdown, which might last for days, weeks or even months, depending on the severity of the damage.During this shutdown period, your cash flow is impacted as your revenue streams grind to a halt!  This scenario clearly emphasises the importance of financial loss compensation. Furthermore, your business might incur additional, unexpected costs. For instance, you may need to relocate your operations to an undamaged site temporarily, thereby incurring the costs of renting a new space, moving and setting up operations.The degree to which your business relies on its physical assets, such as machinery, equipment or the physical building itself, further compounds the situation. A manufacturing unit, for instance, depends heavily on its production machinery. If these assets are damaged, it will take time to repair or replace them. As a result, your business won\"t be able to operate fully, extending the period of business interruption.In addition, indirect losses can result from property damage too. This could be the loss of key contracts due to your inability to meet commitments as a result of delay or failure in production and delivery. This leads not only to immediate revenue loss but could also damage your business\"s reputation, further affecting your profitability in the long term.To keep your business functioning despite these sorts of challenges is obviously your goal! Therefore the importance of considering Business Interruption Insurance in your business continuity strategy is clear.Typical types of property damage covered by insuranceInsuring your business against property damage is vital to shield it from unforeseen circumstances. A Comprehensive Business Insurance policy typically covers a variety of risks, such as the following:Fire Damage: A small spark can turn into a massive blaze, causing irrevocable loss if you&rsquo;re not insured. A comprehensive policy usually covers fire damage, allowing businesses to recover and resume operations as quickly as possible.Water Damage: Whether the source is a burst pipe, problematic plumbing, or weather-related events like floods, water damage can ruin equipment, as well as stock, and make your premises uninhabitable, leading to an interruption in your operations.Weather Conditions: Damage due to weather conditions, such as lightning strikes, hailstorms, or strong winds, is typically covered by business insurance. Such conditions can wreak havoc, destroying buildings, structures, roads and wiring/electrical systems.Impact Damage: The damage to your property caused by a falling tree or some other object could hamper your ability to operate normally.Explosions: These are particularly relevant for factories that deal with volatile substances, where a gas leak or an industrial accident could result in a massive explosion, causing extensive damage.Accidental Damage: A good business insurance policy will generally provide coverage for accidental damage, such as that caused by a factory worker inadvertently using the wrong tools.Malicious Damage: From broken windows to damaged goods, the destruction caused by vandalism &ndash; or a robbery &ndash; can result in considerable financial loss.Electrical Damage: With a lot of business operations relying heavily on electrical equipment, electrical malfunctions can halt operations and lead to significant repair or replacement costs.While a good Business Insurance policy will cover the property damage outlined above, you should check the type of Business Interruption cover it includes. This is because various property damages can also disrupt regular business operations.Calculating business interruption lossesUnderstanding how to calculate business interruption losses is crucial when it comes to filing a business interruption claim. The process isn\"t straightforward, but with careful attention, it can be managed effectively.1. Gather all necessary financial data: This involves collecting and organising critical financial documents such as profit and loss statements, sales reports, revenue projections and other relevant records from before and during the interruption. The more detailed your records, the more accurate your claim will be.2. Determine the exact period of interruption: This is the time from when the damage occurred to when your business operations returned to normal. It\"s crucial to keep records of these dates.3. Identify the net loss income: Calculate the revenue you would have generated during the period of interruption &ndash; had the event not occurred &ndash; and subtract the actual revenue earned during that period.4. Account for ongoing expenses: Some costs continue even when your business isn\"t operational. These can include rent, utilities, loan repayments and salaries of key staff members. Include these costs in your claim.5. Deduct saved expenses: Not all business operations continue during an interruption. Some costs, such as certain supply expenses or temporary staff wages, might cease. Deduct these saved expenses from the loss calculation.6. Factor in the recovery time: This is the time it takes for your business to return to its usual level of operating performance after the repairs are completed. This period should also be factored into the calculation as it might involve additional losses.By being thorough, you can help ensure your business recovers the maximum amount it is entitled to, thus providing you with crucial support while you return to normal operations.How to file aBusiness Interruption Insurance claimFor a better understanding of filing a Business Interruption claim, consider this hypothetical situation. You own a thriving boutique bakery in Johannesburg. One night, a severe electrical storm hits, and a lightning strike causes a fire at your bakery.The fire causes significant damage to your building, requiring extensive repairs. All your baking equipment inside the building is destroyed, and your existing stock of ingredients and freshly baked goods ready for the next day\"s sales are lost. As a result, you\"re forced to shut down your bakery temporarily. In addition, due to the unforeseen closure, you cannot fulfil a substantial contract for a corporate event. To mitigate the loss and continue some level of operation, you set up a smaller bakery at a rented location across town. However, this venue can only cater to walk-in sales and not large orders, thus affecting your revenue.In such a scenario, to file an insurance claim, you would first report the incident to your insurance provider. They would guide you through the claims process and let you know what documentation is needed.You\"d need to provide all necessary documents to substantiate your claim, including financial records and details about the loss. This could involve photographs of the damage, repair and replacement estimates, financial data showing your business\"s performance before and after the interruption and documentation of additional costs incurred due to the temporary relocation.During the claims process, maintaining open and regular communication with your insurance provider is crucial. They can advise you, answer your questions and keep you up to date on the progress of your claim. Remember that while this process can be rigorous and time-consuming, it\"s an essential step to help your business recover and continue its operations.Get a Business Insurance quote for Business Interruption InsuranceProtect your business and leave nothing to chance.

The growing trend of freelancing in South AfricaIn South Africa, the trend of freelancing has been on a steady upswing, influenced by a mix of global and local factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a crucial trigger, compelling businesses to adapt and individuals to reconsider their working arrangements. The resulting shifts in workplace dynamics have prompted many to embrace the flexibility and independence offered by freelancing.Advancements in technology have further facilitated this transition. Digital platforms have made it easier than ever to connect with potential clients locally and globally and deliver a vast range of services remotely. As a result, physical boundaries are less significant, opening unprecedented opportunities for South African freelancers.In this burgeoning freelance market, certain industries stand out for their growth. The tech industry, including roles like web development and IT consultancy, is an area of rapid expansion, fuelled by the digital transformation of businesses across sectors. Creative fields such as graphic design, content writing, and digital marketing are also flourishing as brands strive to differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace. And it\"s not just limited to these sectors&mdash;freelancing is being embraced in areas as diverse as financial consulting, educational tutoring, and even healthcare services.This shift towards freelancing also mirrors broader social changes. A desire for work-life balance, autonomy in work, and diversified income streams has drawn many to freelance work. Although there are no formal statistics relating to freelancing in South Africa, World Bank estimates show that self-employed workers grew by almost 14% between 2015 and 2021.Professional and business risks faced by freelancersIn the landscape of freelancing, there are a number of professional and business risks that could put both your income and reputation on the line.Contractual issues are one such risk. It\"s not unheard of for clients to dispute deliverables, challenging the quality and timeliness of a freelancer\"s output. Even if a dispute doesn\"t lead to legal complications, you could still face financial losses and reputational damage.Intellectual property (IP) infringement is another major concern. Freelancers, particularly those in the creative and tech industries, may inadvertently use a client\"s proprietary information or protected content. For instance, a freelance graphic designer could unknowingly use copyrighted imagery in a design, leading to possible legal battles and financial liabilities.The risk of negligence also looms large. Even the most conscientious freelancer could overlook a crucial detail or make an innocent mistake that has significant consequences. A freelance event planner, for example, could overlook a key dietary requirement for a client\"s event, leading to serious health consequences for a guest and potential legal repercussions for the planner.Data privacy and security are governed by strict regulations in many countries, and freelancers sometimes handle sensitive client data. An inadvertent leak of sensitive data would be problematic for both the client and the freelancer.These risks underline why it is essential for freelancers to be adequately insured. With Professional Indemnity Insurance, freelancers can mitigate these risks, ensuring they are financially protected and able to bounce back from potential setbacks.Types of freelancers who need professional indemnityProfessional indemnity is applicable to a wide range of freelancers, reflecting the diverse nature of this rapidly growing work category. Different types of freelancers face specific challenges and risks associated with their professional expertise and service offerings. Here are some categories of freelancers who would benefit from this type of business coverage:1. Business Advisors and ConsultantsFreelance business coaches, financial advisors, and marketing consultants all offer professional advice that is supported by their specific expertise and experience. However, no advice is infallible, and freelancers in this field face considerable risks. This is especially the case if a client experiences financial losses that could be attributed to a freelancer\"s recommendations.2. Designers and Creative ProfessionalsGraphic designers, web designers, and other creative professionals such as writers and photographers frequently work with original content. Freelancers in these fields face potential risks arising from claims of copyright infringement and IP-related disputes.3. IT Consultants and ProfessionalsFreelance web developers, software engineers, and IT consultants face a distinct set of risks. These vary from unintentional violations of software licensing agreements to allegations of negligence and a greater risk of data breaches and privacy violations.4. Health and Wellness ProfessionalsMost personal trainers, nutritionists, health coaches, and other health and wellness professionals are freelancers. The risks they face include physical injuries to their clients, along with potential health issues clients experience following their advice and training.5. Education and Training ProfessionalsFreelance tutors, coaches, and training professionals are also not free from risks, which can include allegations of inadequate or incorrect instruction leading to unsatisfactory outcomes.In each of these cases, Professional Indemnity Insurance can provide invaluable protection. Safeguarding against potential financial losses and legal complications arising from professional mishaps allows freelancers to operate confidently and focus on delivering their best work.Benefits of Professional Indemnity Insurance for freelancersProfessional Indemnity cover comes with a host of benefits tailored specifically to freelancers.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Your Car Insurance Claim Can Be Rejected if You Do These 10 Things When you\"ve dutifully paid for car insurance for years, you may assume that insurers will consider your long-standing relationship with them when you eventually make a claim. In reality, you may find that things go differently, and instead of receiving a payout, you could find your car insurance claim rejected. Discover more about car insurance claim rejection reasons as First for Women discusses these mistakes in more detail.  What does rejection mean in a car insurance claim? According to the South African Ombudsmanfor Short-term Insurance, car insurers rejected a record number of claims[1] last year. A rejection means your claim won\"t be processed because you failed to honour your car insurance policy\"s contractual obligations. A rejection differs from a claim denial, which means that although your claim was valid, it\"s being rejected because your policy excludes it.10 common car insurance claim rejection reasons Take a look at these 10 things that could get your car insurance claim rejected:  1. Not paying your premiumsYou can accidentally miss a premium payment and have your debit order bounce when you get a new salary date if the deduction date falls on a public holiday or you forget to renew your coverage when it expires. Your insurance can be completely cancelled if you don\"t make a payment arrangement during the grace period. You can prevent this by checking that your debit orders go off on the right day or by paying your premium manually if you get paid on different dates. 2. Delaying filing your car insurance claimThere\"s never a convenient time to have your car break down or experience an accident. Unfortunately, you have a given time frame to lodge a car insurance claim. Otherwise, your claim will be rejected.  3. Providing incorrect information with your claimKeeping your policy information and claim details up-to-date and accurate will prevent you from inadvertently providing incorrect information. Your insurer should be informed of any change that impacts your risk factors. This could include a home move or beefed-up car security.  4. Allowing an undesignated person to drive your carIt\"s common for households to share a vehicle out of convenience or necessity. There\"s no problem with this, but it adds another person to the picture, and their risk profile could significantly differ from yours. If this person has an accident in your car, insurers may reject your claim outright unless you\"ve added them as an official secondary driver. 5. Not keeping your vehicle roadworthyHonouring your vehicle\"s service and maintenance schedule shows you\"ve played your part in keeping your car in good condition.  6. Neglecting your initial insurance inspectionInsurers sometimes require a vehicle inspection when you first take out insurance to determine the state of your vehicle. This means you must bring your car in for a physical inspection, which many people delay.  7. Driving recklessly or under the influenceDriving intoxicated is unwise &mdash; not just because you could harm yourself and others. Just because you feel fine after a few beers don\"t mean you\"re sober enough to drive, and breathalysers use your blood alcohol levels and not your behaviour to determine if you\"re over the limit &mdash; which is breath alcohol  0.24mg per 1,000ml or blood alcohol limit of 0.05g per 100ml. With ridesharing services widely available and affordable, there\"s no reason for you to drive at all in this state. Similarly, texting while driving is considered reckless and puts you in the wrong. 8. Leaving the scene of an accidentIt\"s normal to panic and feel confused after a car accident. Even if you\"re unharmed and your car still functions, you must stay at the scene until the police arrive.  9. Insufficient car insurance coverIt\"s essential to know what your policy does and doesn\"t cover. For example, if you finance your car, having a write-off cover ensures you don\"t owe the financier any money. The right coverage will also repair damage indirectly caused by primary car accident damage. Business vehicles will also require specialised cover because your claim can be rejected if a claim involves using a private vehicle in a business capacity. 10. Neglecting car security measuresYour insurer may require that you install security measures in your vehicle, like a tracking device. Not doing this can create avoidable risk that leads to a claim rejection.Discover more about How to submit an insurance claim with First for Women. What to do if your car insurance claim is rejected?If your insurer has rejected your claim for car insurance, you can follow certain steps to dispute their decision. Follow your insurer\"s complaint process and submit a written account of the dispute with any other required documents. If this fails, you can organise an assessment from an independent loss adjuster, who will make an impartial report and send it to your insurers. You can also escalate the issue to the Ombudsman for Short-Term Insurance by following their processes or seeking legal advice, potentially landing the matter in court.

        "content": "Reaching retirement is a milestone that brings significant lifestyle changes. A shift from active employment to a more relaxed pace of life is the most notable change, but there are other changes, too. Together, these warrant careful re-consideration of various aspects of your life, including your Home Insurance. 1st for Women recognises the importance of adapting your insurance policy to align with your evolving lifestyle. That&rsquo;s why we have compiled this guide to help you prepare for the changes retirement brings.How retirement changes your lifestyleRetirement doesn\"t simply mean you are no longer employed full-time. There is that, of course, but you should also expect other lifestyle changes that could impact your daily living, financial planning and social interactions.One of the first changes you will experience is the disappearance of your daily interactions with colleagues. To avoid a sense of isolation, it is essential that you work on new social connections and spend more time engaging with old friends. If you use the extra time you suddenly have on new hobbies, travel, volunteering or even a part-time job, you\"ll have no difficulty establishing new connections. However, all of this occurs within the limits of a more tightly managed budget.Another immediate change when you retire is the loss of your regular monthly income from your job. In 2022, South Africa\"s population included over five million people aged 60 or older. Many retirees might want to remain in their current home that is familiar and where they are comfortable. However, a 2022 survey revealed that only one-third of individuals aged 50 and above felt confident that their savings would last for their entire retirement period. For some retirees, there might be better cost benefits in downsizing or moving into a retirement village.Changes in social interactions and living arrangements are not the only challenges you need to consider. As you get older, you may also have to contend with age-related health concerns becoming more prominent. A comprehensive medical aid and an effective support system can help with this, but you also need to consider how this may influence your living arrangements.Regardless of what your living arrangements end up being in retirement, the need for House Insurance remains. However, your new lifestyle does necessitate a fresh look at your policy and cover, which could bring about a welcome reduction in your premium.Home Insurance considerations for retireesAs your lifestyle changes, so do your Home Insurance needs. This is never more pronounced than in retirement. It is essential that all changes are communicated to your insurer as they happen &mdash; from your actual retirement through to changes to your home and personal belongings.As a retiree, you may end up travelling extensively. Being away from home for extended periods changes your risk profile, which can be mitigated by additional security measures. You also need to consider the impact of alterations to your home and House Insurance, whether for operating a home-based business or to keep your house user-friendly as you get older. Communicating with your insurer and reviewing and updating your policy regularly is the only way to ensure you always have appropriate coverage &mdash; both before and during retirement.Home modifications for safety and accessibilityYou want your home to be safe, comfortable and accessible. As you age, you might need to modify your home to better accommodate your changing mobility and health needs. Some changes would be simple, such as:Installing brighter motion-sensor lights for ease and better visibility.Using a smart speaker or voice-activated assistant to make it easier to set reminders, control other smart devices and make phone calls.Installing a new security system that can be controlled remotely, with cameras that can be accessed via a smartphone.Others will require a little more effort, such as:Replacing slippery flooring with non-slip options and removing trip hazards like rugs or uneven flooring.Ramps in place of some stairs and a stairlift if your home has multiple levels.A walk-in bathtub or shower to reduce the risk of falls.Grab bars and railing near the toilet, shower or bathtub for added support and balance.Lowered cabinets and pull-out shelves to make storage more accessible.Regardless of the modifications you make, it is essential that you discuss them with your insurer. If you&rsquo;re concerned about the impact of alterations on your insurance premium, another viable option is to downsize. This also gives you the opportunity to find a home that is already more accessible, thus requiring fewer changes.Downsizing for retirement and its impact on your Home InsuranceDownsizing is a common step for retirees &mdash; swapping a larger home for a smaller, more manageable house, apartment, or retirement community. Even if it&rsquo;s something you have decided and planned for in advance, the process can still be stressful, and it&rsquo;s easy to forget that this decision doesn\"t only affect your lifestyle but also your Homeowners Insurance.The location and other features of your new home could affect your risk profile, which could, in turn, influence your monthly premiums. The property value on smaller homes is usually lower, too, and the lower cost to rebuild or repair could reduce your insurance needs.It is essential that when you update your insurance with the details of your new property, you also update your home inventory. Downsizing usually means having fewer possessions, as you get rid of excess furniture and other belongings before you move. You are likely to need less coverage for personal property after downsizing, which could further reduce your insurance premiums.Not all lifestyle changes that follow retirement have a positive impact on your risk profile and insurance premium. You should also consider occupancy changes brought about by increased time away from home when travelling.Estate planning and Home InsuranceHome Insurance has an indirect &mdash; and often overlooked &mdash; role in your estate planning. Estate planning is all about documenting how your assets should be distributed when you pass away. Your home and its contents often make up a significant portion of your estate.With adequate Homeowners Insurance, you\"re able to ensure that the value of your property is protected against fire, natural disasters or theft, thus preserving the worth of your assets for your beneficiaries. It is also recommended that you include details of existing policies in your estate planning. This allows your beneficiaries to adjust coverage and other details once the property is transferred.The importance of regular policy reviewsRegular reviews of your Home Insurance are crucial, with the ideal schedule being yearly. It is an opportunity to check that your coverage is adequate, reducing the risk of being over or under-insured. However, once you retire, changes to your lifestyle can be more significant, thereby raising the importance of regular policy reviews.The first of these should happen when you retire: inform your insurer that you have retired. This is also an opportunity for you to discuss significant changes, both planned and completed and how these might affect your coverage.Then, as new changes occur, you should again review and update your policy. Changes could include making alterations to your home, moving, acquiring or disposing of valuable items, and changes to your driving and home occupancy patterns. In addition, if you&rsquo;re concerned about the cost of your insurance, you should get other Home Insurance quotes to compare.Get a 1st for Women insurance quoteYour Home Insurance should align with your lifestyle and needs at all stages of your life.

        "content": "Our cellphones have become so much more than just a phone. They\"re still an important connection to family, friends, and business, but they\"re also how many of us now bank, shop, take notes, and set reminders. Lose your phone, and you lose access to all of that &mdash; in addition to contacts and gigabytes of photos. This is why at 1st for Women, we see Cellphone Insurance as a necessity and not a luxury because, even if all your important data is backed up to the cloud, you&rsquo;d still struggle to be without a phone for any length of time.What is Cellphone Insurance, and why do you need it?Cellphone Insurance is a specialised Portable Possessions Insurance product that works like most other insurance products. You pay the insurer a monthly or annual premium that is calculated on the value of the device at purchase rather than risk. In return, the insurer provides cover for your phone in various situations. Depending on the circumstances, the insurer will cover the cost of replacing or repairing your phone, usually with a lower insurance excess payable by you.As they have become smarter and more powerful, cellphones have become an extension of our lives. Juggling your professional and personal life increases the risk of your cellphone being damaged or lost. This makes phone insurance a practical and essential tool for protecting your mobile device against a range of risks; and ensuring continuity in your personal and professional life.The most common types of Cellphone Insurance claimsInsurance claims are made based on a diverse range of circumstances that reflect the many ways in which our mobile devices can be compromised. However, there are some types of claims that are more common than others.Screen damage: The face of most cellphones is all screen and very susceptible to damage from a strong impact or being dropped &mdash; and even a small crack can affect functionality.Theft and loss: The high value and portability of cellphones make them a popular target for thieves, but their compactness also makes them easy to misplace.Liquid damage: We like to take our phones with us everywhere, which puts them at risk of spills, being dropped in water and exposure to rain and moisture.Manufacturing defects: Defects that become apparent after the manufacturer\"s warranty has expired can affect your phone\"s performance or render it unusable. However, you need to be aware that this type of claim is not covered by all insurers.Accidental damage: Whether it is because you forgot your phone on the roof of your car or sat on your phone, accidental damage can be significantly worse than a cracked screen.These common claim types highlight the importance of insurance for your mobile devices and of choosing a policy that covers the specific risks your phone is subject to. Most phone insurance policies cover accidental damage, loss and theft. An all-risk plan will often protect you against more risks.  What does Cellphone Insurance not cover?While comprehensive phone insurance does have certain limitations and exclusions that you should be aware of, understanding these not only ensures you select the right policy but will also help you manage your expectations.Commercial use: If your cellphone is used primarily for business, a standard phone insurance policy might not cover it due to the different risk factors and usage patterns involved.Intentional damage: Whether caused by you or someone else, deliberate damage to your cellphone is typically not covered.Pre-existing issues: Any faults or damages that came about before you insured your phone are not covered. Insurers might require proof of the phone\"s condition before activating your policy.Unauthorised repairs: Having any repairs done to your phone by an unauthorised service provider can void both the phone\"s warranty and insurance coverage.Cellphone accessories: Insurance on cellphones usually applies to the device only. Any accessories such as earphones, chargers or phone cases that are damaged or stolen with the cellphone are not covered.Cosmetic damage: A small dent or scratches on the phone that don\"t affect its functionality or performance are not covered by insurance. Gradual degradation from normal wear and tear is also usually excluded.Loss of data: While some insurance policies might cover unauthorised use of your phone, loss of data such as photos, contacts, and other digital files is not typically included.Force majeure (also referred to as an Act of God): Damage or loss arising from unforeseeable and unavoidable catastrophes, including natural disasters, war, and civil unrest, is usually excluded.Software-related issues: Software malfunctions, bugs and viruses are generally not covered as they aren\"t considered damage in the traditional sense.Always check the policy details carefully before taking out Portable Possessions Insurance. This will ensure that you understand the limits of the cover and end up with a policy that is suited to your needs.Tips to avoid cellphone damageEven with a comprehensive policy in place, it is still advisable to adopt proactive measures to protect your cellphone from damage or theft. Steps you can take include:Using protective gear: Choose a durable case that offers protection against impact. Materials like silicon and rubber have good impact resistance and also offer a better grip. Tempered glass screen protectors offer an extra layer of protection against scratches and cracks.Be mindful of water: Many newer phones include water-resistant features. However, this still doesn\"t protect phones against prolonged exposure to water and moisture. It is better to keep your phone away from bathrooms, kitchen counters, and other areas prone to water exposure.Regular maintenance: Keeping your phone\"s software updated ensures better software security and performance. But cleaning it regularly &mdash; using appropriate products &mdash; is also essential to keep exposed ports clear of dirt.Increasing awareness in public: This doesn\"t only mean not leaving your phone unattended or exposed. Using your phone in crowded areas doesn\"t only increase the risk of theft, but it also increases the risk of the phone being bumped out of your hands.Using security features: Built-in security features like biometric locks and passcodes won\"t necessarily prevent your phone from being stolen. However, it can keep your personal information and your banking app from being accessed.Careful handling: When carrying your phone around with you, make sure that it is separated from sharp objects, such as keys, to prevent scratches and damage. It&rsquo;s a good idea to keep your cellphone in a dedicated space in your bag or inside a protective pouch.The above steps, along with having the best Cellphone Insurance, ensure a comprehensive approach to keeping your device safe and operational.How to get Cellphone Insurance?Securing phone insurance with 1st for Women is a straightforward process designed to provide comprehensive protection for your mobile device.

While having the number of an emergency clinic on hand will help injured guests get prompt medical assistance, it won\"t protect you should they take legal action against you. You could be held responsible if a guest\"s belongings are damaged or stolen on your property. Adding to your Homeowners Insurance cover can protect you should this happen. Keep reading to find out why comprehensive Homeowners insurance from 1st For Women that includes liability coverage is a good idea.Understanding Homeowners Insurance Liability CoverFor most women, Homeowners Insurance in South Africa brings to mind coverage for your home\"s physical structure. While this is true, comprehensive Homeowners Insurance can also be modified to include coverage of the secondary costs you\"re responsible for should your home need accident repair and any additional costs arising from the result of it. For example, if your home is temporarily rendered uninhabitable, your primary insurance will cover the cost of the repairs to restore it to its former state but won\"t pay for the alternative accommodation you\"ll need to live in until your home is ready. You can also expand your Homeowners Insurance coverage to pay for any medical payments or personal liability claims you face as a result of someone getting injured on your property. It will also cover your costs should someone demand compensation for their belongings getting damaged, stolen or lost on your property. Common misconceptions about Homeowners Insurance &amp; liability coverMisconceptions on liability cover can keep you from experiencing its full benefits. Here are a few common ones that may be familiar to you: &ldquo;All types of liability are covered&rdquo; &mdash; Liability coverage only protects you should you or a designated family member accidentally or through negligence injure someone or damage or lose their belongings on your property. It won\"t protect you should you deliberately do any of the above.All belongings are covered&rdquo; &mdash; While you\"ll get liability coverage for damage to most belongings, rare or high-value ones may not be eligible for this and could require additional coverage that accounts for their higher values or rarity.&ldquo;My pets are covered&rdquo; &mdash; Many liability insurance products omit injuries or damages caused by pets or exclude specific pet breeds. &ldquo;I\"m covered if I work from home&rdquo; &mdash; If you operate a business from home you will need to take out separate business insurance that\"s either generic or specifically caters to the industry you work in. This shouldn\"t be overlooked as it\"s estimated that up to 220 000 workers sustain injuries in the job every year. Worker&rsquo;s Compensation Insurance will protect you against claims raised by staff members who get injured on your home office or business property. &ldquo;I can use this insurance to keep my home in good condition&rdquo; &mdash; While you\"ll get coverage for damages stemming from an accident, negligence or unpredicted event on your property, your claim may be rejected if it\"s determined that a lack of maintenance led to the incident occurring.Why Homeowners Insurance matters for injuries on your propertyYou may feel like your home is a safe and well maintained space and that you\"re unlikely to need liability coverage. Before you dismiss it, here are a few examples of situations that take place in homes more often than you think that could take place when having a close friend over or hosting a large social event:Any accidental injury &mdash; This can include someone slipping, tripping and falling on your property for any reason. It can also include someone hurting themselves on a hazard or having something fall on them. For example, they can walk into a clear sliding door that they thought was open, trip while running down a polished passageway or fail to duck their head when entering a low ceilinged room. Any negligence-related injury &mdash; Someone could get injured on your property because you\"ve accidentally created a situation where a hazard is present. This can be leaving a tripping hazard out, not packaging dangerous items away from human contact or failing to leash a pet with a reputation for violence. Having liability coverage can cover you financially or one or more of the following claims: Legal defence costs &mdash; Should someone take action against you, you will get covered for the cost paying for a legal team, for the cost and fees related to the proceeding itself and for any lump sum payments you\"re required to pay the person who made the claim.Medical costs &mdash; You could be requested to pay the full medical expenses relating to someone\"s treatment and recovery from an injury sustained on your property. This can be accompanied by a legal claim or stand by itself.Tips for homeowners to reduce risks of injuries on propertyTo ensure you only use your liability insurance when you really need it , you can prevent injuries and damages from taking place at home by doing the following: Conduct an audit &mdash; an audit from an impartial assessor will alert you to any potential hazards in your home and provide you with a recommended maintenance schedule to update any repairs you\"ve made. This will keep your home safe and preserve its value. Invest in lighting &mdash; ensure shadowy or poorly lit areas of your home are illuminated with adequate lighting. This can also put off intruders.Invest in storage &mdash; Keep pathways and floors clear of clutter by investing in secure storage.Maintain your garden &mdash; keep areas where people walk and gather or park free from low hanging branches or falling hazards.Invest in fencing and railing &mdash; railing and fencing can keep pets secure and keep children away from hazardous areas. Railing can help people navigate around these areas securely.

When it comes to entrepreneurship and eventually running a business, securing your venture with the right type of insurance is a strategic move that can result in substantial rewards. As you navigate the complexities of protecting your business, 1st for Women can guide you through the intricacies of Business Insurance in 2024.  Getting to grips with the - dynamic nature of business  In South Africa, entrepreneurs must navigate a changing environment filled with challenges, unique circumstances, and exciting opportunities. When looking at the country&rsquo;s economic fabric, it becomes evident that businesses are dynamic entities shaped by both internal and external factors. A 2023 survey[1] from the Entrepreneurs\" Organisation (EO) South Africa chapter found that South Africa&rsquo;s entrepreneurial spirit continues to shine through in the face of challenges. 89% of respondents confirmed that they had initiated their own ventures, with these businesses contributing significantly to the economy. The survey highlighted the importance of bolstering policies to foster business growth.  South Africa boasts many businesses, from small enterprises that drive local economies to larger corporations that make significant contributions to the global market. With a growing number of individuals venturing into business ownership, these formations contribute to our nation&rsquo;s economic resilience.  Access to funding, regulatory complexities, and market fluctuations are some hurdles entrepreneurs face. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for growth, impact, and innovation. Certain industries are experiencing transformative shifts, generating new avenues for development and growth.  The real estate market, for instance, stands out as a trailblazer by adapting to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements. The rise in innovative solutions, such as immersive technologies and desktop appraisals, reflects an industry embracing evolution. The tech sector is another example of an industry fostering a rapidly growing ecosystem of startups and enterprises. As well as contributing to the economy, these professionals showcase South Africa as a hub for innovation.  For a business to succeed in a changing climate, preparedness and adaptability have become a necessary trait for entrepreneurs. Business Insurance in South Africa is necessary for financial protection and business continuity.  Understanding the nuances of the local market will equip businesses to navigate challenges and seize new opportunities.  Top 6 business risks to look out for in 2024 As businesses navigate their way through the year, they will need to recognise and address potential risks. This will require effective management, strategic preparation, and robust insurance as a key component of risk mitigation. Some of the top risks to be alerted to in 2024, include:  Energy supply shortage (power outages) Power outages continue to cast a shadow on business operations in South Africa[2]. The unpredictability of the supply poses a threat to productivity and revenue. Business owners must assess the impact on their operations and consider insurance coverage that protects against financial losses that stem from power-related interruptions. 2. Economic downturn  Economic shifts and uncertainties can translate to decreased consumer spending, tightened budgets, and potential financial struggles for businesses. Comprehensive Business Insurance can act as a safety net, offering protection against changes in the economic environment that may impact revenue and sustainability.  3. Unemployment  Business owners need to anticipate the ripple effects of unemployment on their customer base and plan accordingly. They need to consider circumstances under which their customers may be unable to fulfil financial obligations due to job loss. Business Interruption Insurance can be an invaluable tool in reducing financial impact during challenging economic times.  4. Water supply shortage  Water shortages can result in operational challenges for businesses, especially those reliant on a consistent supply. From agriculture to manufacturing, these industries may face disruptions that impact their output. Tailored Business Insurance, which includes coverage for property damage and business interruption, becomes essential to cope with the consequences of water supply shortages.  5. Cyberattacks Data breaches and ransomware incidents can result in significant financial losses and reputational damages for a business. Cyber Insurance becomes a vital component of risk management, offering protection against the financial repercussions of cybersecurity incidents and any financial difficulties incurred owing to operational downtime 6. Natural catastrophes (weather-related) Weather-related events, such as severe storms and floods, can result in major risks to businesses. Property damage, supply chain disruptions, and operational shutdowns are all potential outcomes. Tailored insurance coverage, including safeguarding against natural catastrophes, ensures businesses can navigate the aftermath of weather-related incidents.  Business is constantly evolving. Your Business Insurance should, too  Expansion into new markets, new products and services, and changes to the scope of operations are all part of the evolutionary journey for businesses. With each alteration comes a shift in risk dynamics. An annual reassessment of your Business Insurance coverage will ensure that it aligns with the evolving aspects of your business.  Cybersecurity has become a grave concern for businesses in a growing digital age. The increasing frequency and sophistication of attacks warrant a proactive risk management approach. Businesses are advised to consider including Cyber Security Insurance to mitigate the impact of any breaches, attacks, or other cyber threats.  Understanding that Business Insurance is not a one-size-fits-all solution is critical to tailoring your coverage to the specific needs of your business. This involves a thoughtful selection of policies that will form a solid risk management portfolio. Key policies to consider include:Public Liability Insurance: Protecting against liabilities arising from interactions with the public. Professional Indemnity Insurance: Safeguards against claims of alleged professional negligence, mistakes or errors. Business Interruption Insurance: Minimise financial losses during periods of operational disruption following a natural disaster.. Cyber Insurance: Defend against the financial damage of cybersecurity incidents.

Speak to one of our knowledgeable 1st for Women consultants for professional advice on aligning your coverage with your business needs.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Anyone who has organised an event will tell you there are many risks you must be prepared for. Even small events, such as baby showers and children\"s birthday parties, are vulnerable. While it is impossible to eliminate all hazards, risk mitigation and risk transfer remain an essential part of event planning. Event Liability Insurance is a form of Special Events Insurance from 1st for Women that works in tandem with risk mitigation, protecting you and your business if covered, should unforeseen incidents occur at your event. In this article, we explore the role of Event Liability Insurance in risk management. Why is risk assessment important in events? Potential hazards can have serious consequences in event planning.  From injuries to attendees to damage to property or equipment, unforeseen incidents can lead to significant financial losses. In addition, negative experiences and accidents at your event can harm your reputation if you&rsquo;re not covered by insurance, making people reluctant to support your future events or for future suppliers to engage with you. This is the reason why a risk assessment is a requirement for many events in South Africa1, even including those considered low risk. By conducting a thorough risk assessment, you can identify potential problems in advance and proactively address them through preventive measures or contingency plans and by purchasing the right kind of insurance coverage. This not only protects the safety and security of attendees, staff, and vendors but also safeguards your business\"s financial stability, continuity, and reputation.  Typical types of risks at events and functions Although multiple factors influence the actual risks, there are some risks common to many events that organisers should be aware of, which include:  Operational risks: Property damage from accidents or vandalism and health issues from food and beverage services, such as food poisoning and allergic reactions, are two significant risks that event organisers could face. Health and safety: This includes both physical injuries to attendees and staff, as well as broader health-related issues. Fire: The risk of fire is a serious concern due to some of the portable electrical equipment used, along with the potential to cause injury, fatalities and property damage, as well as disrupt the event. Weather-related risks: Outdoor events are particularly susceptible to weather, including heavy rain, storms and extreme temperatures. Security threats: These include a range of issues, from theft and vandalism to more severe concerns like violent behaviour. Legal and regulatory non-compliance: Failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements can lead to legal issues2, fines or the event being shut down by the authorities. Logistics and transportation risks: Risks can include poor traffic management, accidents or failures in transportation logistics. Supplier or vendor failure: Depending on external suppliers or vendors for aspects of the event introduces the risk of non-delivery, substandard performance or last-minute cancellations. It is important to understand all of the risks associated with events so that you can plan how to mitigate against them. But even with the best mitigation in place, things can still go wrong and that is where risk transfer mechanisms like Events Liability insurance are important to protect against financial and reputational ruin. Risks covered by Event Liability Insurance Unforeseen incidents can derail well-planned events. Event Liability Insurance offers peace of mind that you have financial protection against potential mishaps at your event. Key areas covered by this insurance include: General liability coverage: The core of Event Liability Insurance is protection against third-party claims of bodily injury or property damage due to event activities. Consider a corporate retreat where a guest slips on an unmarked wet floor, sustains a sprained ankle, and threatens legal action for negligence. General liability coverage would address the guest\"s medical expenses and any associated legal fees. Property damage: Designed for instances where the venue or rented equipment is damaged, this coverage addresses physical damage to structures, furnishings and other property caused by attendees or event activities. For instance, a guest at a wedding reception in a historic mansion accidentally damages a decorative piece. Property damage coverage would assist with repair or replacement costs, subject to the policy&rsquo;s limits. Medical expense coverage: This covers the medical expenses of injured guests and event staff, irrespective of who is at fault. It offers immediate financial aid for injuries without any need for legal proceedings to establish liability. A practical example is a child injuring their arm during a game at a cultural festival. The medical expense coverage would cover emergency treatment costs, potentially avoiding a bodily injury claim against the event organiser. Legal defence costs: Events might occasionally give rise to legal disputes, leading to lawsuits against your business for property damage or injuries incurred during the event. This coverage assists with legal defence expenses, including attorney fees, court costs. Consider a disgruntled vendor at a craft market claiming the event setup caused damage to a display case full of their products. They sue you for loss of income and damages. Legal defence coverage would support defending your business in such disputes. Despite offering more comprehensive cover than Public Liability Insurance, you should still expect insurance for event planners to have coverage limits and exclusions. Cover for alcohol-related incidents is the most common exclusion, but some policies could also exclude claims related to extreme weather or event cancellation. Ensure the limits and exclusions align with the potential risks of your event. How to conduct a risk assessment for event planning Risk assessment is crucial for minimising the impact of unexpected incidents that can disrupt your plans or harm your reputation.  Proactively manage risk by doing the following as part of your risk assessment: Define the scope: Clearly outline the event\"s objectives, audience demographics, activities and timeline. This sets the boundaries for your risk analysis. Assemble a team: Gather key stakeholders from various areas (planning, venue, security, etc.) to bring different perspectives on potential risks. Identify risks: Have thorough brainstorming sessions where you consider operational, safety, financial and reputational hazards. Think through everything from weather issues to social media backlash. Assess likelihood and impact:  Use a simple scoring system to prioritise risks. Consider the probability of a risk occurring and its potential consequences. Develop mitigation plans: For each major risk, devise preventive measures, transfer strategies (like insurance) and contingency plans (what to do if things go wrong). Allocate resources: Based on your mitigation plan, determine budget and staffing requirements for safety and contingency measures. Review regularly: Revisit your risk assessment as the event plan evolves. Update it to reflect any changes that introduce new risks. Document and report: Maintain detailed written records of your risk assessments.  This is important for accountability and post-event analysis. Post-event evaluation:  Analyse what worked, what didn\"t and where you got lucky. Use these insights to improve future event planning and risk management processes. For medium- to high-risk events, including those requiring one-day liability insurance, consult with experts on specific risk areas. Communicate clearly with your team about the risk mitigation plan; everyone should know their roles and responsibilities.

        "content": "We&rsquo;re all aware of the theory of self-love, but how often do we put it into practice? Consciously and consistently showing ourselves love is not a luxury, it&rsquo;s a necessity &ndash; especially in a time when our resilience is being tested like never before. Far from being an airy-fairy concept, psychologists attest to the fact that self-love and self-compassion are critical to our mental health and wellbeing1. And we couldn&rsquo;t agree more. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve put together a list of fearless tips to help you keep the self-love alive.Whatever you do, do it dailyExercising our self-love muscle regularly is vital to reaping the rewards of our practice. You can vary your self-love routine as much as you like, depending on the day and the time you have available. Some self-love techniques however can be practised all day long, like progress not progression and talk to yourself like you would to someone you love.Progress not perfectionFocus on the progress you&rsquo;re making in working towards your dreams or changing your habits. We tend to be extremely harsh on ourselves when we don&rsquo;t achieve perfection in everything we do &ndash; from sticking to an exercise routine and reaching career milestones to being the ideal mom and partner. The important thing to remember is that we&rsquo;re always learning and growing, and to meet our perceived mistakes or failings with self-compassion rather than self-judgement.Relaxation techniques for a calmer body and mindThere is great power in the simple act of breathing. If you&rsquo;re having a stressful day, spending even a minute breathing deeply, in a quiet space, can reduce anxiety and slow your racing heart rate.Another method to try is the 54321 grounding technique2 to bring your body and mind back to the present. The technique is easy and uses all your senses. Simply focus on your immediate surroundings and silently name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste.With quick daily meditations, apps like Calm and Headspace are fantastic for unwinding on a busy schedule.&ldquo;Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love.&rdquo;This quote from the fearless Bren&eacute; Brown, reminds us that how we talk to ourselves really does matter. We cannot love ourselves and achieve our dreams if we&rsquo;re in constant self-criticism mode, listening to that persistent underlying message: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not good enough.&rdquo; Would you say this to someone you love? Nope. Never! You would be empathetic, encouraging and supportive. Being more aware of how you speak to yourself can drastically change how you feel &ndash; thoughts lead to feelings, so keep those thoughts positive.Exercise with patience and self-compassionEven just a walk around the garden, 10 minutes of yoga or dancing in your living room can be enough to keep your body physically active. Getting a little enjoyable exercise each day is far more beneficial than forcing yourself into an insane exercise regime. Focus on progress not perfection and forgive yourself if you miss a day or two, life happens. While it&rsquo;s important to remain consistent, remaining flexible in our approach is even more so. Nourish your bodyFood glorious food! There&rsquo;s nothing like preparing and enjoying your favourite meal. And with healthier alternative ingredients readily available, it&rsquo;s easy to adjust recipes to your desired lifestyle. The same goes for what you put into your trolley and what you order at restaurants. Being more mindful of what you eat can greatly improve your energy levels and mood. But again, flexibility is key &ndash; if a craving for ice-cream strikes, dig in!Nurture your connections Don&rsquo;t dismiss the power of a hug from someone you love, a cuddle with a pet or a quick call to a dear friend. Over the last year, we&rsquo;ve become more accustomed to connecting virtually but there&rsquo;s still nothing like a physical connection. If that&rsquo;s not possible, work video calls with friends and family into your daily routine. Venting about a stressful day, sharing a laugh or a cry, are all cathartic ways to relieve stress and increase our good feels.Get creativeEver heard of Creative Therapy? We hadn&rsquo;t either but we love it! While creative therapy relies on guidance from a therapist, you can still enjoy some of its benefits, on your own. And if you&rsquo;re about to say: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a creative bone in my body&rdquo; have you tried taking pencil crayon to paper? Colouring in books for adults have become extremely popular in recent years and provide and easy and relaxing way to unwind."

Respondents could provide responses that ranged from &lsquo;completely safe&rsquo;, &lsquo;safe&rsquo;, &lsquo;neither safe nor unsafe&rsquo;, &lsquo;unsafe&rsquo; and &lsquo;completely unsafe&rsquo;.\nAdditionally, reported crime statistics per 100,000capita were considered within the Safest Provinces Index scoring. This included serious crimes (murders, sexual offences and rape), assaults with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, car jackings, robberies at residential premises, property-related crimes, burglaries, and theft of motor vehicles.\nTaking these data points into account, the province scoring the highest overall safety score is Limpopo, which emerged as the province where the female population felt the safest. They boast consistently high safety scores across all categories and reported the lowest number of annual crimes, including assault and murder.\nWhile the NorthernCape and North West exhibit some areas of concern, with high crime figures forspecific categories of &lsquo;Reported theft of motor vehicles&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reportedburglaries,&rsquo; both provinces scored very well in the overall category of&lsquo;Feeling safe in the province.&rsquo; However, the EasternCape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Free State showed mixed safety performances across all categories. Gauteng follows closely behind, with most respondents feelingunsafe, especially in the &lsquo;Walking alone at night&rsquo; category.

That&rsquo;s where 1st for Women can help. Amidst the triumphs and tribulations of being a female entrepreneur, Small Business Insurance is important in ensuring your venture is adequately protected. Our helpful guide is tailored specifically for women in business, providing practical tips and insights on how to navigate the complexities of Small Business Insurance, empowering you to continue to thrive in the face of the unique challenges and uncertainties that come with being a woman running a business in South Africa today. The growing presence of women in business in South Africa Small businesses are the cornerstone of the South African economy, crucial for providing job opportunities, driving innovation and boosting economic growth. Recent data from the 2024 SONA[1] shows that South African small and medium-sized businesses (SMMEs) make a considerable impact on the country&rsquo;s GDP, with a contribution to the economy of over R900 million.  What&rsquo;s particularly interesting is women\"s rise in prominence and impact within the entrepreneurial sphere. In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the number of female-owned businesses across various industry sectors. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), women comprise 58%[2] of Africa&rsquo;s self-employed population. These entrepreneurial operations are pivotal in societal change and economic advancement. While facing obstacles, such as limited access to funding and gender-related biases, female entrepreneurs overcome these challenges, demonstrating resilience, ingenuity and perseverance in their business pursuits. With initiatives designed to support women in business gaining momentum, there is a growing acknowledgement of the contributions made by women-owned businesses in supporting the nation&rsquo;s economic prosperity. As the entrepreneurial landscape transforms, establishing an environment that promotes and encourages women to excel in business becomes essential for facilitating sustainable growth and nurturing inclusive economic development in South Africa. The business landscape for women-owned businesses Female entrepreneurs in South Africa encounter many challenges while navigating the business world. Despite their significant roles in advancing economic expansion and innovation, persistent gender-based hurdles hinder achieving their full potential. From restricted access to financial resources and support to gender biases and societal expectations, women face numerous obstacles in launching their enterprises and achieving success. However, resilience and resourcefulness triumph as they continue to overcome these challenges.  Women can improve their expertise and flexibility in a dynamic marketplace by dedicating time to upskilling and continuous learning. Building a network of supportive peers, mentors, and allies provides valuable guidance and motivation throughout the journey. Prioritising self-care is necessary to maintain overall resilience and well-being amidst business pressures. Negotiating confidently, leveraging networking, and being aware of the latest technology developments are key strategies for navigating challenges and capitalising on opportunities within the competitive landscape. Furthermore, investing in insurance provides essential security and peace of mind. Tailored insurance, such as Event Liability Insurance for professional event planners or wedding coordinators, can protect against unforeseen risks and liabilities, allowing intrepid entrepreneurs to concentrate on expanding their operations.  Efficient delegation, setting clear goals and objectives, and embracing courage in times of hardship inspire women to prosper in business. Through proactive problem-solving and playing to their strengths, women-owned businesses continue to spearhead innovation, promoting economic empowerment and shaping the future of entrepreneurship in South Africa.

        "description": "",
        "content": "When you\"re going about your life, you probably aren\"t thinking about encountering an accident &mdash; let alone how you\"d recover financially. While it\"s human nature to avoid thinking about worst-case scenarios, proactively protecting yourself against risks doesn\"t mean living your life in fear. Personal Accident Insurance from 1st for Women can protect you financially in case of an accident. However, before you commit to a policy, it helps to know the reality of Personal Accident and Injury Insurance. Discover more as 1st for Women uncovers four common myths about Personal Accident Insurance cover that you may not know are false. What is a Personal Accident, and how does cover work? A personal accident refers to an unforeseen event causing bodily injury, disability, or death to an individual. It typically involves slips, falls, or injuries sustained from vehicle accidents. Individuals may purchase a Personal Accident policy to protect them against such unforeseen events. Although there are different definitions between insurers, most insurance companies define Personal Accident Cover as a form of financial protection that you pay monthly in exchange for compensation for the fallout of injury, hospitalisation, disability or death resulting from an accident. It usually takes the form of a predetermined, fixed lump sum payout. It can cover accidents like trips and falls, contact crimes, drowning and most vehicle accidents. Like most forms of insurance, it usually excludes incidents where you were intoxicated, deliberately harmed yourself or broke the law. Check your Personal Accident policy to understand the exclusions more clearly.  Personal Accident Cover is a value-added product, which means that you can add it to an existing primary insurance cover. While it could be added to many different insurance offerings, an example of an application that would benefit South Africans would be adding it to your Car Insurance in case you were hurt during a car accident. Common personal accident myths  Knowing common beliefs concerning Personal Accident and Injury Insurance could help you determine the level of coverage you need and show you why you need it in the first place. Here are four misconceptions you should know about. 1. Myth #1: Medical aid and Personal Accident Insurance are the same Medical aid and Personal Accident Insurance[1] cover are complementary, not identical. Medical aid[1] will cover certain predetermined costs after an accident, limited to your medical treatment and recovery, but it won\"t cover you in the case of death. Personal Accident Insurance cover will pay out a lump sum in the event of an accident for you to spend as you choose. Consider this example: Personal trainer Priya is driving back from a late-night session with an athlete client when a drunk driver hits her car, shattering her leg. Her medical aid covers the cost of rushing her to the hospital for emergency surgery and pays for the months of rehabilitation she needs to learn to walk again. Her Personal Accident Insurance cover pays her a lump sum, which she uses to cover the loss of income she experiences from being unable to work for months. This allows her to pay for costs like her home loan bond, groceries and her son\"s school fees while she recovers. 2. Myth #3: Personal Accident and Injury Insurance is only suitable for high-risk people  You may think you don\"t need insurance because you live a sedentary lifestyle and are unlikely to get into a dangerous situation. Accidents can happen to anyone at any time and location! You could require extensive downtime to recover from an injury, which could keep you from working and leave you with bills to pay.  3. Myth #4. Personal Accident Cover is limited to medical expenses only If you are injured or pass away in an accident, you and your family may face more costs than just medical treatment. With medical costs as high as they are, many people focus on hospital bills and forget that there are many others that you\"d need to pay &mdash; or leave for your family to pay when they\"re grieving you. For example, if you\"re permanently disabled &mdash; even if you can keep working &mdash; you may need to purchase mobility aids to allow you to function as normal or modify your home to accommodate your new limitations or specifications. Personal Accident and Injury Insurance will cover these costs. Get a Personal Accident Insurance quote While you can\"t get a warning about an accident, you can protect yourself from the fallout if it should happen. With the right insurance, you can protect yourself from the costs of an accident so you can get back to living the life you deserve with minimal disruption. 1st For Women can offer you a Personal Accident policy that covers you.

        "content": "Accidents happen. So do hailstorms, minor collisions and other unforeseen mishaps that can leave you with a damaged car &ndash; but dealing with the aftermath of insurance claims and repairs shouldn\"t derail your life. Comprehensive Car Insurance is designed to have your back with the broadest range of protection. At 1st for Women, we want our customers to know how to navigate Car Insurance claims, repairs and unexpected events confidently. It\"s all about gaining the knowledge and understanding the support you need to get back on the road. What does Comprehensive Car Insurance mean? In addition to covering damage you may cause to a third party&rsquo;s vehicle, Comprehensive Car Insurance provides the most extensive protection for your vehicle. It covers repairs or replacement of your vehicle if it\"s damaged or stolen, regardless of fault. This is unlike Third-Party Car Insurance, which only covers damages you accidentally cause to someone else\"s property. While Third-Party, Fire and Theft Insurance also covers your car being stolen or damaged by fire, it doesn\"t cover your vehicle against accidental damage.Comprehensive Insurance has you covered across virtually every imaginable scenario &ndash; from being stolen to being damaged by a falling tree branch, dinged by a shopping trolley or vandalised. While it typically costs more than Third-Party Insurance, the extra protection can be well worth it. Having this level of coverage can help you avoid expensive out-of-pocket repairs and get your car back on the road quickly.Understanding the insurance claims and repair process Unlike having your car serviced or the tyres changed, you hopefully shouldn&rsquo;t have to submit a Car Insurance claim regularly. Because it is often unknown territory for many,  the process of claiming and having your vehicle repaired can seem very daunting. Knowing the steps to follow can help you remain calm after an accident and avoid unnecessary delays in getting your car repaired.Safety first: Your priority is the well-being of yourself and others involved. If anyone is injured, call emergency services immediately. Secure the scene as best as possible using hazard lights, warning triangles, etc.Exchange information: If other parties are involved, get their names, contact details, insurance information and number plate info. This is crucial for your insurance claim.Document the scene: Take photographs of the damage to your car, the position of any involved vehicles and any relevant aspects of the scene (skid marks, road conditions, etc.). The more evidence you have, the easier it will be to build a strong claim and get your car repaired or replaced.Gather witness information: If there are witnesses to the incident, obtain their contact information, as their statements may help support your claim.Avoid admitting fault: Stick to stating the facts of the incident, and don\"t admit liability to other drivers or your insurer1. This is for your claims adjuster to determine.Get a police report: If the police attended the scene, obtain a copy of their report and the Accident Report (AR) number. If the police did not attend the scene, you must still report the accident to them within 24 hours.Contact your insurance company: Report the incident to your insurer as soon as possible2. Even if there\"s uncertainty about filing a claim, it\"s better to alert them immediately. They will guide you on the next steps.Be thorough and honest: Provide a detailed, accurate account of the incident and the full extent of damages to your car. Your insurer needs this information to process your claim fairly.Understand the claims adjuster\"s role: Your claims adjuster investigates your case and works to determine the extent of your insurer\"s responsibility. Be prepared to answer questions and provide any additional information requested.Visit approved repairers: Many insurers have a network of approved repair shops that offer quality workmanship and seamless communication with your insurer. These streamline the process and may minimise additional costs to you.Get multiple quotes: Get at least two or three quotes for the repair work. This helps you compare prices and ensure fair costs. You should also try to negotiate with the repairer if the quote seems unreasonable. Don\"t skip any of these steps and rush to have your vehicle repaired. Ask your insurer for clarification on any part of the process you don\"t understand. Consider the example of Sabrina, who returns to her parked car and finds a long scratch along the driver\"s side. Although she has Comprehensive Car Insurance cover, Sabrina decided not to report it to her insurer and just take it in for repairs. Unfortunately, the bill she receives after the repairs is much higher than she expected. Sabrina only contacts her insurer after seeing the repair cost. However, because she did not document the incident or immediately report it to her insurer, her claim was denied. Understanding the role of insurance in repair costs Your insurer plays a crucial role in managing the costs associated with repairing your vehicle after a covered event. Here\"s how this typically works: Excess: This is an agreed-upon amount you pay towards the repair costs, with your insurer covering the rest. The excess amount depends on your policy and the nature of the claim and is usually included in your policy documents. There are different types of excess, such as a flat amount or a percentage of the total claim.Deductibles: In some cases, insurers also apply a deductible in addition to your excess. This is another amount, separate from the excess, that you pay towards repairs.Coverage limits: It\"s important to understand that Comprehensive Car Insurance has limits. This means it covers repairs up to a certain amount, usually the market value of your vehicle. If repair costs exceed this, you\"ll probably be responsible for the difference.Approved repairers: Working with approved repair shops helps your insurer avoid inflated costs and minimises the risk of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses for you.Get a Comprehensive Car Insurance quoteFeeling more confident about the claims and repairs process?

        "content": "Is your wallet feeling thinner at month end? You aren\"t imagining it. With the cost of living increasing, essentials cost more than ever before, and we\"re all looking for ways to cut back. One of the first things people tend to cut back on is services like insurance. Before you do this, it\"s worth considering whether you could save by switching to more affordable Car Insurance. The first step to doing a Car Insurance comparison? Exploring whether you\"re overpaying for your current insurance. Here\"s how to tell if you are and how Car Insurance from 1st for Women could fit the bill.   4 signs  you may be overpaying for Car Insurance  Here are some of the reasons you may be paying more than you should be for your insurance. 1. You haven\"t done an insurance assessment in a while Life can get very busy, and the average person has many things competing for their attention on any given day. It\"s natural to put off an activity like making insurance comparisons. You may have taken out insurance months or even years ago without stopping to check if it still meets your needs. During this time, a lot may have changed, such as your risk factors and coverage requirements. It\"s a good idea to reevaluate your insurance needs every time your lifestyle changes or once a year. Also, consider Comparing Car Insurance Cover to assess your needs.  2. You\"re carrying more coverage than necessaryUnlike other assets you may insure (like your home or business), a car starts to depreciate the moment you purchase it. This means that your premiums shouldn\"t dramatically increase annually. However, expect the moderate annual premium percentage increase that your insurer would have communicated to you in advance. Keep track of these increases, and discuss any spikes with your insurer.  If you find your monthly premium is a bit steep, ask about discounted plans, like insurance bundling, that could decrease your premiums.  3. You haven\"t informed your insurer about a lifestyle changeMany lifestyle changes can qualify you for a discount in insurance, but only if you inform your insurer about them. This can include a change in how often you drive, a move to a different location or an upgrade to your home and car security. Perhaps you commuted to the office daily but now work from home. Or you could have moved to a safer, gated neighbourhood or installed a tracking system in your car to deter criminals. Tell your insurer about your new circumstances. 4. You haven\"t inquired about available discounts and benefitsGet value for money with 1st for Women benefits, like Guardian Angels Lifestyle Assist. Often, you may qualify for certain discounts from your insurer for not claiming for several years or for being a longstanding loyal customer. 4 Tips for getting affordable insurance  Now that you know whether you may qualify for a more affordable insurance premium, here are some tips to help you do so. 1. Consider upping your excess or deductibleYou can quickly reduce your monthly insurance costs without compromising on your coverage by opting for a higher excess in exchange for a lower premium. Another option is choosing a higher deductible, which is the point at which your insurance kicks in. Bear in mind that doing this means that, should you need to pay for a claim after an accident, you\"ll need the excess amount ready and waiting to avoid delays in repairing your car. 2. Enquire about rates for bundling insurance policiesInsurers can offer discounts if you have more than one car insured with them or multiple insurance products, such as your Life Insurance or Home Contents Insurance. Consolidating all your insurance needs with a single provider can help you take advantage of this. 3. Become a better driverYour premiums are calculated according to your risk level based on your driving. More than 800,000 road accidents[1] are reported in South Africa each year. These can be attributed to factors like speeding, reckless driving and distracted driving. Making a conscious effort to obey the rules of the road can prevent accidents, as can taking an advanced driving course that teaches defensive driving. 4. Improve your car\"s safety and securityA car equipped to withstand break-in or theft attempts or that can better avoid car accidents may qualify for a lower premium. Check with your insurer about what additions you could make to qualify for a reduction. A popular one is to install anti-theft technology or a tracking device in your car to increase its chances of detection and recovery should it be stolen. The importance of reviewing your Car Insurance  policyKeeping your insurance affordable is an ongoing effort. You will need to break down every service or value addition you pay for that may not benefit you anymore or that you will need in the future. Unlike many other products or services, insurance is fluid. Knowing your changing needs will allow you to adapt your coverage to prevent being over- or underinsured, which is money you won\"t be able to return. This proactive approach will also help you keep your insurance in mind whenever you drive, motivating you to cultivate better driving habits to reduce your premiums. Get a Car Insurance quoteYou could be enjoying a much lower Car Insurance premium by making a few adjustments or enquiries. But what happens when your current insurer can\"t offer you a better deal? 1st for Women can help you with this. All you have to do is contact us for an obligation-free Car Insurance quote for quality cover you can trust.  &mdash;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sources:[1] City Press: The critical state of road safety in SADisclaimer: The information in this article is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial, legal, or medical advice."

        "content": "You\"re rushing to work, picking up the kids or heading home after a long day &ndash; and suddenly your car breaks down. Fortunately, Roadside Assistance is a benefit included with most 1st for Women Car Insurance policies. It\"s all about helping you feel safe on the roads.  Here is how we recommend you handle vehicle breakdowns &ndash; whether you\"ve run out of fuel, locked your keys in your car, have a flat tyre, or aren\"t sure what&rsquo;s gone wrong. What to do if you experience a vehicle breakdown  The moment your car gives out, your safety is the top priority1. Pull over in a safe area if you suspect continuing to drive might cause further damage (strange noises, smoke, etc.). Once your vehicle is stationary, assess the situation calmly and do the following: Turn on the hazard lights: Even if it&rsquo;s the middle of the day, turning your vehicle\"s hazard lights on improves visibility.Stay in your vehicle: Don\"t get out of your car to see what the problem is. Instead, ensure all the doors are locked, and your windows are up. Call for help: Immediately contact  Roadside Assistance. We recommend downloading the 1st for Women app that is useful for crash detction and emergencies.  Call roadside assistance services 1st for Women offers excellent  Roadside Assistance as a standard benefit. It\"s a support system you probably don\"t ever think about until you\"re stranded on the side of the road. And then it is a lifesaver that protects your wallet. Because calling for help when you\"re hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town can be expensive without Roadside Assistance services. If you\"ve never paid much attention to this benefit, here are some of the services our benefit can assist you with: Change flat tyres: They can either replace the flat tyre with your spare tyre or repair a puncture if possible.Jump starts: If the cause of the breakdown is a flat battery, they can give it a boost to get you going again.Fuel delivery: It\"s easy to overestimate how much fuel you still have and end up with nothing but fumes in the tank. They can deliver enough fuel to help you reach the next service station.Towing and a lift: If the breakdown is more serious &mdash; or you\"ve been in an accident &mdash; they can arrange for a tow truck to tow your vehicle. They will also provide you with a lift to wherever you are heading. Naturally, when calling for assistance, there is some information you will need to provide:Your membership number or ID number: This allows them to verify your coverage and your account information.Vehicle registration number: This helps them confirm it is the insured vehicle while also making it easier for them to identify you on the road.Details of the situation: Give them as much information as possible about what is wrong. This will help with ensuring the right type of assistance is sent out.Your location: Be as precise as possible; provide an address if you can, otherwise a road name and any landmarks to help them pinpoint your location.  The Guardian Angel on Call Roadside Assistance benefit from 1st for Women&rsquo;s app will provide your precise location. You\"ll also be able to track the assistance provider &mdash; including tow truck &mdash; so you always know how far away they are. Liaise with your Car Insurance provider Once you\"re safe, contact your car insurer. Roadside Assistance doesn\"t automatically trigger a claim; you need to notify your insurer separately to initiate the claims process. And if your need for help was the result of an accident, fire damage or windscreen damage, a claim will be necessary. Once you can, you will need to submit an accident report, including:Your policy number.Your vehicle registration: As with Roadside Assistance, this helps your insurer confirm it is the vehicle listed in your policy.Incident details: Clear description of the incident and other relevant information, including the date, time, and location.  Depending on the nature of the incident, you may also need to provide: A police report.Details of any other parties involved in the incident, including witnesses.Photographs or a video of the incident scene and visual evidence of the damage. With 1st for Women, you can submit a claim by calling the Claims Department or, for maximum convenience, via the app. You can\"t have vehicle repairs done until your claim is approved by your insurer. As part of the claim process, your insurer might arrange for an assessor to inspect your vehicle and the damage first. They will then ask you to get multiple repair quotes for comparison. Not reporting the incident, or failing to gain approval for your claim before having your vehicle repaired could see your insurer reject your claim. Like Sarah&mdash;who gets caught in a hailstorm on her way home from work&mdash;you could find yourself in a costly situation after an accident. Sarah\"s car was damaged, requiring towing and windscreen replacement. Without contacting her insurer first, she arranged the repairs herself. This led to her claim being rejected.  Get First for Women roadside assistance and support Don\"t let the fear of breakdowns hold you back. With the right insurance and support network, you can hit the road with confidence, knowing you have help on hand.  Get a 1st for Women quote and experience the peace of mind that comes with exceptional safety support and Car Insurance. &mdash;-----------------------------------------------------------------------Sources: [1] Women on Wheels:  https://www.womenonwheels.co.za/tips/sa-women-in-danger-with-car-trouble-spot-these-8-issues-before-you-get-stranded/ [2] IOL: https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/news/police-blame-poor-lighting-as-crime-spikes-on-major-roads-a35a7f28-2c1c-4014-a590-9d0868586969 Disclaimer: The information in this article is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial, legal, or medical advice."

        "content": "You\"re reviewing your Car Insurance terms and conditions when you spot a line that makes you pause. While your comprehensive coverage protects you against loss, theft and damage, your tyres and rims are excluded. At first glance, this seems unfair. After all, why shouldn\"t your tyres and rims be covered? You may not know why separate insurance exists for these car parts. Discover more, as 1st for Women provides some understanding about this form of insurance and why you should consider Tyre and Rim Insurance from 1st For Women. Types of damage affecting your tyres and rims Your car\"s tyres and rims are among its hardest-working parts. It\"s easy to take them for granted until they give you issues. This means that issues go undetected until they\"re advanced or keep you from driving safely. Here are a few common problems related to tyre damage[1] you may encounter with your tyres and rims:Wear and tear&mdash;All tyres will develop wear and tear, no matter how good a driver you are. The most common sign of wear and tear is tyre tread smoothing over time. This can happen evenly or unevenly if you overload your car, brake and accelerate harshly, overinflate your tyres, fail to check your wheel alignment or avoid rotating your tyres when necessary.Punctures or cuts &mdash; This can happen at any time and place and is a common form of tyre damage. Anything from a piece of glass to a nail can cause a puncture, and depending on how big or deep it is, your pressure will drop quickly or slowly. This can cause a flat tyre or a more dangerous blowout. Smaller punctures can often be fixed with a plug without replacing the entire tyre.Bulges or cracks&mdash; Bulges can occur because of potholes, speeding, or colliding with objects. They indicate damage to the tyre\"s inner cords and plies (internal layers). Cracks in your tyre take place as the rubber ages and can also be caused by temperature extremes or sun and UV exposure. Tyre insurance does not cover all types of tyre damage. General wear and tear, for instance, is not covered. However, some damage caused by South Africa\"s potholes, which have increased by over 67% over the past five years[2], would be covered.  Who should take out Tyre and Rim Insurance? If you regularly drive on South Africa\"s roads, you\"ll benefit from taking out Tyre Insurance. Car tyres come with a reasonable lifespan, but the more you drive, the faster you can expect them to wear out. This form of insurance may be less worthwhile if you only use your car for occasional errands and drive on very safe roads.  What does Tyre and Rim Insurance cover and exclude? Generally, Tyre Insurance protects you from several yearly tyre and rim incidents. You are also limited to a certain number of repairs per incident. It also won\"t cover you should your car get damaged in an accident or stolen if you have comprehensive insurance coverage. Like most forms of insurance, you can expect a claim to be rejected if it resulted from you breaking the law in any way, be it drinking and driving or partaking in drag racing. What are the benefits of tyre insurance? Having insurance to cover the cost of replacing a damaged tyre or rim is beneficial for obvious reasons &mdash; but what less obvious benefits could Car Tyre Insurance afford you? ●      Avoid emergency spending &mdash; When one tyre needs replacing due to a covered incident, like hitting a pothole, you will be covered. This saves you money as you won&rsquo;t have to dip into your savings to pay out-of-pocket expenses for a new tyre. ●      Keep your premiums low &mdash; While you could claim on your comprehensive insurance for tyre damage, you should be aware that this could affect your premiums and your eligibility for a cashback bonus as you must remain claim-free for a certain amount of time. Dedicated Care Tyre Insurance can solve this problem. This helps preserve your primary Car Insurance for serious and costly emergencies, helping keep your insurance premiums low.●    Preserve your car\"s value and appearance &mdash; Without Tyre and Rim Insurance, you may ignore related issues to avoid the cost of fixing them immediately. This can create hidden damage in a car and shorten its overall lifespan. As a result, the resale value decreases, and your car may require costly parts and replacements.

The main cause of allergies is: Environmental Allergens: Pollen, dust mites, mold spores, and certain plants can cause allergic reactions when inhaled or when they come into contact with the skin.Food Allergens: Proteins such as beef, chicken, dairy, and grains like wheat or soy are common food allergens. Pets may react to specific ingredients or additives in their diet.Flea Saliva: Flea bites can trigger severe allergic reactions in some pets, leading to conditions like flea allergy dermatitis.Contact Allergens: Materials such as certain fabrics, plastics, or cleaning products can cause allergic reactions when they come into contact with the skin.Dust and Mold: These are persistent allergens that can affect pets living in indoor environment.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Scammers use a wide range of tactics for financial gain. As technology advances, they continuously adapt their techniques to catch people out. If you&rsquo;re shopping, banking, selling something online or even swiping right hoping to find your perfect match &ndash; you&rsquo;re at risk of falling victim to a scam. The fraud landscape has steadily increased over the past five years and according to the Southern African Fraud Prevention Service (SAFPS), South Africans are increasingly becoming easy targets. While the financial and retail sectors are fraud hotspots, the SAFPS points out that money-muling is still one of South Africa\"s most significant challenges. This is followed by forged documents, impersonation fraud and employee application fraud. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what each one of these means.  Money-muling According to the SAFPS, one of the most common forms of money muling is when a victim is approached by someone claiming that they need to receive money from a family member in another country and they need a bank account to perform this transaction.  Many people want to help and willingly let these fraudsters use their bank accounts.  While this may seem an innocent crime, research points out that money-muling funds criminal activities. Impersonation fraudAn example of impersonation fraud is when criminals contact an unsuspecting vehicle owner and pose as an official representing a car manufacturer or insurer. They then convince the vehicle owner that their vehicle requires critically urgent safety recall work or some sort of vehicle inspection.   Criminals go to great lengths to make their communication seem official and make arrangements to collect the vehicle. A couple of days later, the owner would typically phone their dealership or insurer for an update, only to discover that their vehicle has in fact been stolen. Employee application fraud Employee application fraud, also known as CV fraud, occurs when someone provides false information or misrepresents themselves on a CV. They forge documents to show they have specific qualifications for the job when in fact they don&rsquo;t. Safety AdviceTo avoid falling victim to fraud, 1st for Women has some tips: 1.     Limit the amount of personal information you share on social media and telephonically. Criminals use this to build a detailed profile of their victims.2.     Be vigilant and maintain a healthy sense of scepticism when talking to strangers. Make every effort to verify that they are indeed who they say they are, and that they are an employee of the company they claim to represent.3.     Check with the dealership/insurer directly to verify that the recall/inspection is legitimate. Don&rsquo;t trust contact details provided by the person who called you.4.     If you&rsquo;re selling a product online, screen potential buyers thoroughly &ndash; if you find anything suspicious about a seller&rsquo;s profile or behaviour, avoid them. 5.     Never release goods to buyers before they have paid for it. If you accept an EFT, check with your bank that the correct amount of money has been deposited, and is secure, before releasing the goods.6.     If you are buying something online, rule number 1 is that if a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is.  If possible, check the seller&rsquo;s rating and feedback.7.     Avoid meeting buyers or sellers at locations that seem unsafe.  Rather opt to meet in a public, busy space.8.     It&rsquo;s prudent to register for your bank&rsquo;s cellphone notification service and receive electronic messages relating to activities or transactions on your accounts as and when they occur.9.     Review your account statements on a timely basis; query disputed transactions with your bank immediately and monitor for small amounts being deducted from your account.  10.  Verify all requests for personal information and only give it out when there is a legitimate reason to do so.11.  Regularly verify whether the details received from cellphone notifications are correct and according to the recent activity on your account. Should any detail appear suspicious immediately make contact with your bank and report all log-on notifications that are unknown to you. 12.  As an extra layer of protection, regardless of whether your identity has been compromised, register on the SAFPS database.  Registration is free and you&rsquo;ll be issued with a number.  When you apply for credit or when you open an account, you may be required to quote this number.   Follow these tips and remember to always trust your gut. After all, it&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry.  "

        "content": " - Is there such a thing as cheap car insurance? - Anyone can get cheap car insurance. However, we believe that when it comes to cheap car insurance, you get what you pay for! Your premium may be cheap, but you might also be locked into a lot of unnecessary rules about how much you can drive, where, and when. At 1st for Women, we don&rsquo;t want to hold you back, which is why we don&rsquo;t place unreasonable restrictions on you. We aim to offer some of the most affordable women&rsquo;s car insurance in South Africa. While it isn\"t easy to put a price on your wellbeing, we strive to maintain affordable Car Insurance designed specifically for women. All while offering excellent coverage and benefits to help you feel safe. That&rsquo;s why you can save money when you switch to 1st for Women. - Can I use a vehicle repairer of my choice? - Since 2004, we have established excellent working relationships with our network of car experts, and we want you to get the most out of this pre-established network. That&rsquo;s why we insist on using panel beaters of our choice. This way, we can guarantee the quality of the work done on your car. In fact, we offer a lifetime guarantee on the repair work when you claim through us, whether it&rsquo;s a quick paint fix or major panel beating. - How do I lower my car insurance premiums? - There are a few ways you can lower your car insurance premiums: Increase the excess you are required to pay when you claim. However, paying the lowest excess will increase your monthly premium. Ideally, you want a balance between your premium and your excess. By combining your policies, you qualify for discounted premiums. Review your cover annually. Individual circumstances are subject to change, including your coverage needs, like if you&rsquo;ve recently moved to a safer area. - What is the best car insurance? - We&rsquo;ve put together our insurance options with all kinds of women in mind. The best vehicle insurance for you will depend on your own needs. Our Comprehensive Car Insurance offers the best protection against the most extensive array of risks. However, if you rarely drive your car or are looking for insurance for an older, less valuable car, Third Party, Fire and Theft or Third Party Only Cover could be right for you. - Will my premiums decrease as my car gets older? - When you insure your car, you aren\"t only covered for theft, but also for the repair of your vehicle. As your car ages, the cost of repairs and individual parts increase every year. Unfortunately, your premium will need to increase to align with these costs. However, 1st for Women does consider the depreciating value of your car when reviewing your premium on an annual basis. "

        "content": "As time passes without incident, you may wonder if you even need Car Insurance at all. Forgoing the protection of insurance isn\"t advisable, but it\"s understandable that you may wonder if you\"re getting as much value out of your coverage as possible &mdash; and if you could be saving money without sacrificing any of it. This is where Third-party Insurance from 1st For Women comes in. Here\"s how to decide whether Third-Party Car Insurance is right for your wallet and car. All about Third-party Insurance - what you should know When it comes to a product like insurance, it\"s natural to err on the side of caution and choose the highest level of coverage you can afford. After all, who wants to be left out of pocket because they chose inadequate coverage? While this is a reasonable approach to adopt, you also need to consider that your needs may have changed since you first chose a Car Insurance product.Third-party Insurance may be a better option for you[1], allowing you to save money without compromising on coverage. This form of insurance covers accidental damage you may cause and are found liable for to someone else\"s property/car while driving. However, it does not cover:Damage to your car (no matter who is to blame)The cost of replacing your car if someone steals it.Consequences of illegal activity while driving your car, like driving without a valid licence or driving while under the influence. Getting to grips with Third-party Insurance inclusions and exclusions To illustrate what Third-party Car Insurance does and doesn\"t cover, here is an example.Bella is a 24-year-old woman who has just graduated from university. She is lucky enough to have been given the old family car, but her parents have told her to cover her insurance.Bella cannot afford Comprehensive Car Insurance Coverage. She only has a part-time job as a server in a coffee shop, works from home where she lives with her parents, and only uses the car on weekends. The car doesn\"t give her trouble but is very old and Bella knows that if it should be damaged, there\"s a good chance she will need to replace it as the cost of repairs would exceed the car\"s value. She is hoping to save up money to get a new car in the next year or two.Bella is aware of and happy with the exclusions and inclusions presented by Third-party Insurance. Bella\"s only real concern on the road would be being held liable for damaging someone else\"s car or property. She is happy to pay a lower premium and channel the savings towards a new car. Weighing up the pros and cons of Third-party Car Insurance You may be wondering if third-party cover is for you. You can get an idea by answering the following questions:How badly will an accident disrupt my life?What is your biggest financial concern if you get into a car accident tomorrow or have your car stolen? Would you be worried about the cost of damage to your car and if you can afford to fix it? Would not having a car majorly disrupt your life? If your car is older, worth relatively little or would be expensive to repair &mdash; and you still need insurance, third-party cover may suit you.What are my finances like?Do you have a realistic view of your financial situation? If so, you should be able to tell what expected and unexpected costs you could handle &mdash; and in what form they come in. For example, if you are relatively debt-free, have savings and prefer to keep your month-to-month costs low, third-party cover may suit your wallet better. However, if a major financial cost would disrupt your budget and you want to preserve your savings, a higher level of coverage may be better. Our expert tips: how to choose a Car Insurance plan  If you\"re still on the fence about getting Third Party Car Insurance, here are some things you can do to decide:Assess your car\"s value &mdash; It\"s important to keep up to date on your car\"s resale value as well as its general parts availability and pricing. While you may have done this in the past, these figures can change unexpectedly. Analyse your driving habits &mdash; The likelihood of you needing to place a claim is directly impacted by how often you drive, where you drive and how long you spend driving. If you don\"t drive often, keep to driving around quiet roads (avoiding traffic and highways) and only drive short distances for the occasional errand, Third Party Car Insurance is more likely to suit you.Consider your risk tolerance - Evaluate how comfortable you are with potential out-of-pocket expenses for your own vehicle\"s repairs after an accident.

        "content": "Comparing Car Insurance quotes can feel overwhelming, thanks to the sheer number of options available on the market. However, making the wrong choice could cost you time and money. At 1st for Women, we understand that finding the right coverage for your needs is crucial for your peace of mind and financial security. Our guide on how to compare Car Insurance quotes will help you avoid common pitfalls that so many people make. Discover the typical mistakes when comparing quotes and how you can avoid them. The drawbacks of overlooking Car Insurance coverage details According to AA South Africa[1], with over 11 million cars on the road and an estimated 60-70% of these uninsured, doing your due diligence can prevent costly surprises and ensure you&rsquo;re protected on our nation&rsquo;s unpredictable roads. Important details can be easily overlooked when looking at different Car Insurance options.  These are some of the factors you need to consider closely when you compare Car Insurance quotes: Insufficient cover may leave you financially vulnerable when you need support. For example, if your policy doesn&rsquo;t include comprehensive coverage, you may be responsible for all your vehicle repair costs in a non-collision event, such as a natural disaster or theft.Gaps in cover lead to high out-of-pocket expenses. For instance, you may assume that your insurance covers rental cars or roadside assistance, when it doesn&rsquo;t, which can result in unexpected costly expenses. Additionally, if your policy has high deductibles, you could end up paying more out of your pocket before your insurance steps in, making an already stressful situation more difficult.You\"re at risk of denied claims due to undisclosed details. Insurance companies require full disclosure of information such as your vehicle usage, driving history, and personal details. If any of the supplied information is incomplete or omitted, your claim could be rejected, leaving you to settle the costs. Discover how your Car Insurance claim can be refused. Incomplete or incorrect information can result in increased premiums. If your insurer discovers any errors in your application, they may adjust your premiums accordingly, potentially costing you more in the long run. Providing inaccurate information could also be seen as an attempt to defraud the insurer, leading to more severe consequences.You may miss out on opportunities for discounts and savings. Many insurers offer savings on things like multiple policies, driving a vehicle with advanced safety features, or maintaining a healthy driving record. Overlooking these details could result in higher premiums than necessary. Don\"t make these common mistakes when comparing Car Insurance quotes! When it comes to comparing Car Insurance quotes, you can avoid common mistakes that can lead to higher costs, insufficient coverage, and unnecessary stress. These are the top 6 mistakes that many people make when they compare Car Insurance that are quite avoidable:1. Missing important coverage detailsReview any policy document thoroughly to ensure it meets your requirements. For example, failing to notice that a policy doesn&rsquo;t include coverage for natural disasters or theft can leave you at risk.2. Not providing accurate informationTo avoid potential issues, ensure that all your details are accurate and up to date. For instance, not disclosing a recent traffic violation could result in your claim being later denied.3. Failing to make proper comparisonsMany people will simply browse at a price on a policy before deciding. However, this approach can lead to insufficient coverage. It&rsquo;s, therefore, essential to review not just the cost but the benefits, exclusions, and terms of each policy. Consulting with expert insurers like 1st for Women can help you make an informed decision.4. Overlooking customer reviews and reputationCustomer reviews and a positive reputation instil trust and confidence in a company&rsquo;s product or services. An insurer may offer attractive premiums, but poor reviews or a slow claims process can lead to dissatisfaction. Do your research on an insurer&rsquo;s ratings to ensure they&rsquo;re reputable.5. Prioritising cost over a quality of coverChoosing the cheapest Car Insurance option without evaluating the policy details is risky. A low premium might result in higher deductibles or less comprehensive coverage. Always compare the cost versus the value provided by the policy to ensure you&rsquo;re adequately covered.Consider this example: Annelise, a Johannesburg resident, chose the cheapest available insurance policy she could find without reviewing the coverage details. After a severe storm, she discovered her policy didn&rsquo;t cover damage incurred from events like inclement weather, meaning she had to pay for the extensive repairs out of her own pocket.If Annelise had taken the time to compare policies and understand the coverage details, she could have taken out a more comprehensive plan that included vehicle damage.  Tips for avoiding mistakes when you compare Car Insurance quotes Efficiently compare Car Insurance quotes with these tips to avoid making common mistakes:Don&rsquo;t rush the process! To avoid overlooking details and making uniformed decisions, take the time to carefully review each option.Review several options. Compare multiple policies from different providers to find the best coverage and rates.Ask lots of questions. Understanding every detail of a policy ensures there are no nasty surprises later. Check the fine print. Being aware of any important policy terms and conditions can prevent any unexpected issues during a claim.Ensure providers are reputable. Always do your research to ensure you&rsquo;re dealing with a trustworthy company.Check limitations and exclusions. Awareness of what&rsquo;s included and excluded in a policy is vital to not being caught off guard in unforeseen incidents.Don&rsquo;t go with the cheapest premium. Compare the cost versus the value provided by the policy to ensure you&rsquo;re adequately covered.

        "content": "As an event planner, you\"ll know that your job can be exciting and glamorous at times and demanding and stressful at others. Your researching, budgeting, planning, negotiating and booking efforts can culminate in a successful and memorable event &mdash; but there\"s always the chance something could go wrong. Safeguard your career and investment with Event Business Insurance. Discover what this type of coverage offers and how Public Liability Insurance from 1st for Women will protect your event planning business. Why is Public Liability Insurance needed for event management? The stakes are high in the business of event planning. The chance of things going wrong at a conference, music festival or wedding is high, and should something go wrong, the buck stops with you! If you haven\"t insured your event management business for liabilities before, it could be difficult to visualise how liability insurance for a one-day event works or what value you\"ll get from the cost of Public Liability Insurance cover. Imagine the following scenario:  Lesedi is a new event company owner who booked a fancy function for a well-to-do client. She\"s excited and anxious about her first big gig and consults her business mentor for advice. He advises her to get Public Liability Insurance as protection against some of the following typical scenarios that often play out at public or private events: Personal injury. Her mentor reminds her that the event will be attended by dozens of guests and staff members. Should anyone in attendance suffer an injury on the premises or during the event, Lesedi could be held responsible, subject to the circumstances of the injury. Property damage. Lesedi has booked a popular venue known for its built-in art installations and unique furnishings. All fixtures of the property will be protected by her Event Business Insurance should they become accidentally damaged during her function.Contractual obligations. The venue has stipulated that Lesedi organise security at the function. If, for some reason, the security detail was found to be inadequate during the event, which resulted in property damage or personal injury, Lesedi could be held in breach of her contractual obligations. In this situation, Public Liability Insurance would cover the costs of any injury or damage and any legal fees. Food and beverage safety. The event banquet will feature a seafood feast, as requested by the client. If the food fails to meet quality standards, Lesedi could be held personally liable following an investigation.   5 Critical benefits of Event Business Insurance Public Liability Insurance cover can come across as something that only addresses the fallout of problems after they\"ve taken place. While this is true, it can also offer the following proactive benefits that can make your career as an event planner far more efficient and a lot less stressful:1. Financial protection. Legal action against your business can rack up costs. Event Business Insurance can provide you with financial protection covering your legal defence and litigation costs.2. Third-party cover. This will cover you for any harm or injury sustained by a third party or bystander who was impacted by one of your events.3. Venue compliance. Most commercial establishments will require an event owner to have Public Liability Insurance as a contractual requirement. 4. Protection for participants. Should anyone in attendance become injured during the event, public liability will cover their medical costs, subject to the circumstances of their injury. 5. Reputation management. Maintain your good name in the industry. Public liability will provide protection against third-party claims or legal issues. There are several types of business insurance recommended for event planners. Take a look at the full scope of Event Business Insurance for event organisers and wedding planners.  How to assess your insurance needs for event planning? Whether you\"re investigating liability insurance for a one-day event or to cover your event planning business as a whole, you should ask yourself several questions to narrow down the type of coverage that will benefit you the most and give you adequate protection. For instance: How many people are going to attend the event?What is the size and scale of the event? For example, will it have secondary locations or take place over several days?What are the risks associated with this event?  It&rsquo;s recommended that you consult with a trained insurance broker to sort out the finer details of what your public liability does and does not cover[1]. They may recommend taking out a separate business insurance policy once you uncover a particular risk, like intellectual property infringement.

        "heading": "Why Sharp Women Get Comprehensive Home Contents Cover",
        "description": "",
        "content": "As crime rates in South Africa remain high and natural disasters become more frequent, safeguarding your home and its contents has never been more critical. 1st for Women understands that a safe and comfortable home is a priority for busy career women and homemakers, which is why we offer Home Contents cover. Our cover caters to the unique needs of South African women. This article looks at why smart, forward-thinking women are choosing Comprehensive Insurance for their home contents. 5 Reasons why South African women need comprehensive cover It wasn\"t until the early 1990s that married South African women could sign contracts, open a bank account, or register a business1 without their husband\"s consent. Since then, South African women have gone on to achieve remarkable milestones, including starting successful businesses and buying property. All of this makes having the right insurance even more important. Insurance protects your material possessions and your financial future. Here are five compelling reasons why more South African women need Comprehensive Insurance for their possessions. 1. Crime rates remain high It\"s no secret that South Africa has one of the highest crime rates globally. In the 2022/23 reporting period, there were around 1.6 million house break-ins and more than 230,000 home robberies2 in South Africa. Comprehensive Insurance will make it easier for you to replace your possessions without significant costs to you if you experience losses or damage due to a break-in. 2. Natural disasters are more common There has been an alarming increase in the number of floods, wildfires, and severe storms in South Africa that also result in significant damage. The devastating floods in KwaZulu-Natal in 2022 were followed by another destructive storm affecting Margate in 2024. The winter of 2024 also saw widespread flood and storm damage in and around Cape Town. Events like these can damage your home\"s structure and its contents. This makes comprehensive cover essential for anyone who wants to protect their possessions from unforeseen natural events. 3. More women are becoming homeowners Recent data shows that the percentage of women-only buyers of property has risen from 16% in 2018 to 22% in 20223. While Building Insurance is mandatory when financing a property purchase, insuring the contents is not. But it is foolish to skip House Contents Insurance. The physical structure of your home might be worth considerably more than all your possessions combined. But trying to replace some, or all, of your possessions following a burglary, fire, or flood would be unaffordable without insurance. 4. Women own more valuable items Modern women want convenience and comfort. This often means investing in high-end electronics and appliances, along with fitting out a home office or home gym. Throw in some luxury fashion items and jewellery, and you\"re looking at a lot of items that warrant protection against loss, theft, or damage. With Comprehensive Home Contents Insurance, you\"ll be able to cover these items for their full value and protect your financial stability. 5. Women are growing in financial independence The total number of people getting married in South Africa, including customary marriages, has steadily decreased since 2011. A greater emphasis on personal freedom has led many to eschew marriage or opt for cohabitation instead. For women, this means being able to hold onto your financial independence. But it also means having to consider more comprehensive insurance to safeguard the life you\"ve built and the future you\"re working towards. Without adequate cover, a single unforeseen event&mdash;whether a break-in, natural disaster, or accident&mdash;can derail your financial goals. How does Home Contents cover mitigate risks? Home Contents cover provides financial protection against a wide range of potential losses or damages to the belongings inside your home. Here&rsquo;s how it helps: Protection against theft: Home Contents cover allows you to replace stolen belongings quickly and without additional financial burden.Cover for accidental damage: Comprehensive Insurance ensures you\"re not out of pocket for repairs or replacements of accidentally damaged items. Safeguard against natural disasters: With Home Contents cover, you\"ll have one less thing to worry about if your home and possessions are ever affected by a natural disaster. Reassurance and quality of life: Knowing that your belongings are covered gives you peace of mind, allowing you to focus on what really matters in your life. How to get the ideal Comprehensive Home Contents cover for your needs If you want to be fully protected against life\"s uncertainties, choosing the right insurance is essential. When presented with so many options, always consider your current needs and your future plans. You can secure the ideal cover for your needs by following these steps: Accurately value your belongings: Create a detailed inventory of your possessions along with their value. Accurate valuation ensures you get the right level of cover, without any risk of over or underinsuring your belongings. Understand coverage limits: Insurance policies come with coverage limits for specific items or categories of items. Understanding these limits will help you decide whether you need to increase cover on your high-value items.Consider accidental damage: Accidental damage is one of the most common types of claims. Check whether it is included, and what types of accidental damage are recognised. Check natural disaster protection: Given the increasing frequency of natural disasters in South Africa, it&rsquo;s crucial to ensure that your policy includes coverage for events like floods, fires, and storms. Especially if you live in a high-risk area.Evaluate deductibles and premiums: The deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in. Lower premiums usually mean higher deductibles, so find a balance that works for your financial situation. There\"s little sense in paying lower premiums if you can\"t afford the deductible when you claim. Look for flexible policy options: Your life will change over the next few years, and so too will your insurance needs. Find a policy that allows you to adjust your coverage as needed. Whether this is to add new high-value purchases or to remove cover for items you no longer own.   See what value-added benefits are included: It\"s rare for insurers not to offer additional benefits that add value to your policy. From roadside assistance, through legal, financial, or tax help, ensure the benefits meet your needs.  Ensure the policy covers items taken outside the home: If you frequently travel with valuable items like laptops, cameras, or jewellery, ensure that your policy covers these items even when they are outside your home.  Look into multi-policy discounts: If you have multiple insurance needs&mdash;such as Car, Home, and Life Insurance&mdash;you may benefit from bundling these with one insurer.

That&rsquo;s where 1st for Women&rsquo;s Portable Possessions Insurance becomes essential. Whether you&rsquo;re exploring a new city or hiking in the mountains, this coverage ensures that your items are protected no matter where your journey takes you. Our guide will help you find out how this insurance can safeguard your belongings and provide reassurance during your trips. The inside scoop on South African women and travel today Whether it&rsquo;s the daily commute to work, a business trip across the country, or a well-deserved holiday to a dream destination, South African women are frequently on the move. Many South African women consider travel a key aspect of their lifestyle. Among the most popular local destinations are scenic Cape Town, bustling Johannesburg and the picturesque Garden Route. These destinations offer a mix of adventure, culture and relaxation, making them excellent choices for women looking to recharge after the stresses and strains of their daily routines. Internationally, the number of South African women venturing to destinations such as Iceland, Japan, Thailand and certain countries in Europe is increasing. A report from Contiki South Africa shows a significant increase in South African women\"s visits to these countries in recent years. Thailand&rsquo;s tropical beaches, Europe&rsquo;s romantic charm, and Iceland&rsquo;s cool vibe make them popular for women seeking both adventure and relaxation. For work-related travel, Durban and Johannesburg are frequent hotspots due to their status as economic hubs. Many women combine business with pleasure, extending their stays to explore the local attractions or indulge in spa treatments after a long day of business meetings. South African women are also not scared to go it alone. A recent travel survey by The Solo Female Travelers Club revealed that 78% of women said that the main reason they travelled on their own was to seek personal growth, independence and relaxation through their journeys. This trend reflects a broader global movement where women are breaking traditional barriers and exploring the world on their own terms. The dangers of travelling alone with regard to your possessions Travelling, whether for business or pleasure, often involves taking your valuable items like a smartphone, camera, laptop, or jewellery. These possessions are not just expensive but also essential for staying connected, capturing memories, and ensuring a smooth travel experience. However, as exciting as travel can be, it also comes with its share of challenges, especially when it comes to your portable devices. When you&rsquo;re on the go, your belongings are exposed to various risks  &ndash; airports, busy tourist attractions and public transport hubs are notorious for pickpocketing and theft. Even an experienced traveller can fall victim to these crimes, resulting in the loss of expensive and indispensable items.  Additionally, accidents happen &ndash; you may drop your camera, damage your smartphone, or have your luggage mishandled by airport staff, resulting in significant damage. Without having the right coverage, the financial implications of replacing these items can be overwhelming. This is where Portable Possessions Insurance becomes crucial. With this insurance, you can travel happily in the knowledge that your gadgets, jewellery, and other items are protected against loss, theft, and damage. 1st for Women&rsquo;s Portable Possessions Insurance offers tailored coverage that means you&rsquo;re not left out of pocket when the unexpected happens. Investing in insurance is not just about safeguarding your items; it&rsquo;s about ensuring your adventures are enjoyable and stress-free. After all, the last thing you want to be worrying about is losing something special without any means to replace it! Portable Possessions Insurance in action Whether you&rsquo;re away for work, heading out on a weekend adventure, or just going about your daily routine, Personal Possessions Insurance ensures your belongings are protected from life&rsquo;s unexpected mishaps. To give you some idea of how it works in real life, here are three common scenarios where it can make all the difference. 1. TheftImagine you&rsquo;re on a business trip, and while enjoying dinner in the city, your handbag is stolen. Inside, you have your designer purse, smartphone, camera, and watch. Without insurance, replacing these items could be incredibly expensive. However, with personal possessions coverage, you can file a claim to recover the value of the items, reducing the financial impact and stress of the situation. 2. LossConsider this: Juggling your bag and a coffee, you&rsquo;re rushing through the airport to get to your gate. In the chaos, you accidentally leave your phone behind at the security checkpoint. By the time you realise it&rsquo;s missing, it&rsquo;s nowhere to be found. Losing an expensive item like this can be frustrating, but Portable Possessions Insurance steps in to cover the loss, allowing you to replace your handset without the financial burden. 3. Accidental damagePicture being on a scenic hike, capturing stunning photos with your high-tech DSLR camera. As you follow a rocky trail, you slip, and your camera falls to the ground, breaking on impact. Repairing or replacing a top-range camera can be expensive, but with Personal Possession Insurance, the cost of accidental damage is covered, ensuring you&rsquo;re not left out of pocket. In each of these examples, insurance provides a safety net, allowing you to focus on what matters the most &ndash; enjoying your travels, without the worry of unforeseen costs. 5 Tips to get the most out of your Portable Possessions Insurance While having the right insurance is vital to protect your possessions while you&rsquo;re travelling, sometimes simply having coverage isn&rsquo;t enough &ndash; you need to make sure your policy is tailored to specific travel needs. Here are five key tips to help maximise your insurance coverage and safeguard your valuables during your adventures. 1. Ensure you have worldwide coverageBefore you head off on your travels, check that your policy offers worldwide coverage. This is particularly important for frequent travellers, as it means your possessions are protected regardless of your destination. Whether local or international, comprehensive coverage is crucial to avoid gaps in protection. 2. Declare or specify high-value itemsIf you&rsquo;re travelling with expensive items such as a laptop, camera, or jewellery, it&rsquo;s important to declare them to your insurer. By specifying them in your policy, they will be fully covered, even when you&rsquo;re on the move. This step is key for high-priced or rare possessions that may require additional coverage beyond your standard policy limits. 3. Understand policy exclusionsEvery insurance policy has exclusions, and it&rsquo;s important to familiarise yourself with them before you travel. Some may have limitations on coverage in certain countries or for specific types of loss, such as theft from an unattended vehicle. Being aware of these limitations helps you avoid unexpected gaps in coverage and ensures you&rsquo;re fully protected. 4. Keep documentation closeCarry digital copies of your ID, policy document, receipts, and proof of ownership when travelling. In the event of loss or theft, having these documents on hand can speed up the claims process. Store them securely via the Cloud, or a digital wallet. 5. Use secure storage solutionsTake extra precautions to store your insured items in secure locations, such as locked luggage or hotel safes. Some insurers may ask for proof of reasonable care as part of the claims process, so taking these steps can help your claim to be processed smoothly and efficiently.

        "content": "When it comes to safeguarding your home, you may wonder what coverage level will protect your possessions. Is a simple policy covering only fire and storm risks right for you or do you need something comprehensive? At 1st for Women, we understand the critical nature of this issue and can help you personalise your Home Insurance for Contents to ensure adequate protection. Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late &ndash; get fully informed to know if Fire and Storm Only coverage will keep all your favourite things safe. The rising risk of fire, damage, and other natural disasters in SA With the changing climate, South Africa is increasingly vulnerable to natural disasters. Fires and storms occur more frequently and intensely, posing a significant risk to property and infrastructure. Fires South Africa is facing a higher incidence of fires, particularly along the country&rsquo;s extensive grasslands and in urban areas. These fires result from a combination of factors including high temperatures, prolonged droughts, and increased human activity. For example, hot, dry weather conditions fuelled the devastating wildfire that swept through the Western Cape&rsquo;s Table Mountain area in 2021. The blaze caused considerable property damage and destruction, with the University of Cape Town campus dealt about R1 billion worth of damage. Consider an example of a family in Cape Town facing a wildfire that threatens their home. The destruction could result in significant financial loss and displacement. Home Insurance for Contents including Fire and Storm Only Home Contents and Buildings Insurance would offset the disaster&rsquo;s financial impact. Impact of floods Floods are another concern in South Africa, exacerbated by poor urban planning and heavy rainfall. Cities like Durban have experienced severe floods, leading to substantial property damage and even loss of life. Known as one of KwaZulu-Natal&rsquo;s worst recorded natural disasters, the April 2022 floods destroyed over 4,000 homes and caused an estimated $2 billion loss to infrastructure and business, Wits research found. The researchers warn that all South African cities and towns must prepare for extreme rainfall events, starting with better planning and improved flood defences. At an individual level, insurance against flood damage will keep your home and its contents covered when the weather turns bad. Storm damage Storms, including cyclones and hailstorms, are becoming more frequent and intense. For instance, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, among other areas, were hit by several severe hailstorms and other storm events in June 2024, resulting in significant damage and power outages. The South African Insurance Association reported a rise in claims related to storm damage, underscoring the increasing severity of these incidents.  Imagine a homeowner in Gqeberha who experiences a severe hailstorm that shatters the windows and damages the roof. Without adequate insurance coverage, the costs of repairs could be extensive. The rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events in South Africa present a growing risk to infrastructure and property. Understanding the potential impact of floods, fires, and storms can help homeowners make informed decisions about their Home Insurance for Contents and disaster preparedness. How to decide if Fire and Storm Only Home Contents is suitable for your needs Choosing the right coverage for your home contents is crucial to ensure that you&rsquo;re protected against potential threats. Fire and Storm Only Home Contents Insurance offers essential protection, but it&rsquo;s important to evaluate whether it meets your specific needs. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you determine if this type of insurance is suitable for you. 1.      Assess your home&rsquo;s risk profileThe first step in the process is to evaluate your home&rsquo;s risk profile. Evaluate whether your property is in a high-risk area for fires or storms. For example, properties in areas prone to wildfires, such as the Western Cape, face a higher risk of fire damage. In addition to natural disasters, other risks include burglaries and general home contents loss. If your home is in a high-crime area, Home Insurance for Contents that includes protection against theft and vandalism may be more suitable. Determine whether the presence of multiple threats warrants comprehensive coverage.  2.      Evaluate your personal possessionsConsider the value of your household contents when deciding on insurance coverage. If they&rsquo;re relatively modest in value, Fire and Storm Only Insurance might be enough. On the other hand, if you have high-value items such as electronics, antiques, or jewellery, you may need additional coverage. Know that you must specify your high-value items in your policy to ensure they are fully covered.  3.      Consider other potential threatsFire and Storm Only Insurance does not include other potential risks such as accidental damage, theft, and vandalism. If these threats are significant to your property, you may need additional insurance. For instance, if you live in an area with high vandalism rates, excluding these threats from your Home Insurance for Contents could leave you financially vulnerable. Evaluate your risk exposure before settling on a policy. 4.      Look at your budgetBudget constraints are another important consideration. Fire and Storm Only Home Contents Insurance is often more affordable than comprehensive coverage. If you&rsquo;re on a restricted budget and cannot afford extensive insurance, this option provides cost-effective coverage against key risks. When weighing up your options, consider whether paying a higher monthly premium for comprehensive coverage could save you money in the long run if your possessions were lost or damaged by a threat unrelated to fire or the weather. 5.      Consult an insurance expert Finally, get professional advice to make sure your insurance meets your individual needs. A 1st for Women consultant can help you assess your risk profile, evaluate your home contents value, and advise whether Fire and Storm Only Home Contents Insurance is suitable or if more coverage is required.  Get a Home &amp; Contents Insurance quoteProtecting your home and its contents is essential for peace of mind.

In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the number of female-owned businesses across various industry sectors. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), women comprise 58%[2] of Africa&rsquo;s self-employed population.

The business landscape for women-owned businesses Female entrepreneurs in South Africa encounter many challenges while navigating the business world. Despite their significant roles in advancing economic expansion and innovation, persistent gender-based hurdles hinder achieving their full potential. From restricted access to financial resources and support to gender biases and societal expectations, women face numerous obstacles in launching their enterprises and achieving success.

Women can improve their expertise and flexibility in a dynamic marketplace by dedicating time to upskilling and continuous learning.

        "content": "The rims on most cars were once made from steel because of its durability and affordability. However, steel rims are heavy, leading car manufacturers to switch to various alloys. Aluminium alloys are much lighter and allow for rims to feature intricate designs.  The downside is that they cost much more. Tyre and Rim Insurance from 1st for Women is a smart way to avoid the high cost of replacing a damaged tyre and alloy rim. Something that happens easily when you hit a well-concealed pothole at the wrong angle. Here&rsquo;s how this insurance provides peace of mind on every journey.   10 key reasons streetwise women take out Tyre and Rim Insurance The Department of Transport&rsquo;s Vala Zonke pothole repair initiative was launched in late 2022. Since then, more than 40,000 potholes have been reported, but fewer than 8,000 have been repaired1.  Unfortunately, this does not account for uneven road surfaces, which, along with potholes, often lead to damaged tyres or rims. Aside from covering the cost of this, there are other reasons smart women opt for Tyre and Rim Insurance. 1. Financial protection against unexpected costsRepairing or replacing tyres and rims can be expensive, especially if the damage is severe or you drive a high-end vehicle with specialised rims. Tyre and Rim Insurance can cover these costs and ensure you don\"t have to dip into your savings or disrupt your monthly budget. 2. Comprehensive road hazard coverageSouth African roads can be unpredictable, with potholes2, debris, and other hazards posing significant risks. Our Tyre and Rim Guard cover isn\"t limited to when you\"re driving on paved, urban roads. Exclusions include vehicles used for racing, damage caused by an accident that is covered by Comprehensive Car Insurance, and damage caused by misuse or neglect.  3. Enhanced vehicle safetyWell-maintained tyres and rims contribute significantly to your vehicle\"s overall safety. By ensuring that your tyres and rims are always in good condition, this insurance helps prevent accidents and ensures your car remains safe to drive. This is particularly important for women, who may be at greater risk when waiting for help. 4. Extended tyre and rim lifespanRegular maintenance and timely repairs, made easier by your insurance coverage, can extend the lifespan of your tyres and rims. This means fewer replacements and better driving performance. 5. Increased resale valueProspective buyers appreciate the assurance that comes with a car that&rsquo;s been properly cared for. A vehicle with a well-documented history of tyre and rim maintenance can command a higher resale value when you decide to sell. 6. Better budget managementWith Rim and Tyre Insurance, you can manage your budget more effectively. The predictable cost of insurance premiums means you can avoid sudden, unexpected expenses resulting from a pothole incident.  7. Versatile coverage optionsTyre and Rim Insurance policies are usually offered as a value-added product. So, you can sign up for it as an add-on to your Comprehensive Car Insurance, or as a standalone policy. 8. Customisable coverage plansThe cost to replace rims or tyres varies from one vehicle model to the next. You can discuss your coverage options and premiums with your insurer. Along with customising your level of cover, you might be able to include Fine Support to help you stay on top of any traffic fines issued against you. 9. Support during emergenciesIn a tyre or rim emergency, having insurance could mean having access to support services. This might include Roadside Assistance, towing, and even accommodation if you\"re stranded far from home &ndash; when your Tyre and Rim cover is added to your Car Insurance. Such support can be invaluable, providing help when you need it most and ensuring that you\"re never alone in a crisis. 10. Peace of mind for every journeyUltimately, Rim and Tyre cover is about peace of mind. Knowing that you\"re covered against potential damage and expenses allows you to focus on your journey rather than worrying about what might go wrong. Tips for customising your Tyre and Rim Insurance policy Choosing the right Tyre and Rim Insurance policy involves more than just selecting a plan. It\"s about tailoring the coverage to fit your needs and circumstances. Here are some tips to help you customise your policy effectively. Evaluate your driving habits and needs: Assess your driving habits and typical road conditions. If you frequently drive on potholed or poorly maintained roads, consider a policy with greater coverage to address the increased risk of damage. Understanding your specific needs will help you choose the right level of protection while minimising your financial risk.Consider your vehicle\"s specifications: Ensure your policy covers your vehicle&rsquo;s requirements. Specialised tyres and rims on luxury or high-performance cars may require more comprehensive coverage.Align coverage with your budget: Determine how much you\"re willing to spend on premiums. Balance the cost with the level of coverage you need to ensure you&rsquo;re getting the best value. It is essential to find a policy that fits your financial situation without compromising on necessary protection.Look for value-added benefits: Check for discounts and bundled policy options. Combining your Tyre and Rim Insurance with other policies from the same insurer can often lead to savings. And an extra benefit such as Fine Support improves convenience for you.Check policy details: Thoroughly review the inclusions and exclusions of any policy. Understanding what is and isn\"t covered can prevent unpleasant surprises when you need to make a claim, especially limits on the number of claims you can make. Clarity on your policy details ensures you\"re fully aware of your coverage limits and conditions.Consult with insurance experts: Speaking with a 1st for Women consultant can help you tailor your coverage to your specific needs and budget. Professional advice ensures that your policy is optimally configured to offer the best protection.

        "content": "Like many countries, South Africa has updated antiquated laws to afford women the same rights as men. However, despite this progress, many women still face unfair practices and discrimination in the workplace. They can also encounter these challenges in family, property, and financial matters. Legal Cover &ndash; such as that offered by 1st for Women &ndash; allows South African women to deal confidently with the unique legal challenges they face. From legal advice and assistance to legal representation, Legal Insurance provides affordable and immediate access to the support needed. Legal challenges women commonly face in South Africa Many of the legal challenges South African women encounter are gender-specific and deeply rooted in social and economic inequalities. Legal frameworks to promote equality do exist, but the reality is often different. The following situations are some of the most common legal obstacles women face. Employment discrimination While South African law prohibits workplace discrimination, many women still face unequal treatment. Pay inequality remains an issue, with women often earning less than men for the same work. Discriminatory hiring practices are also common - with employers favouring male candidates or questioning a woman\"s commitment due to family obligations, including pregnancy. Women may be overlooked for promotions or dismissed due to maternity leave1 needs. Sexual harassment in the workplace can also contribute to making the environment hostile. Without expert guidance, working through the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) can be a slow and complex process. Custody and divorce Family law disputes can have a long-lasting impact on women. This is especially true with opposed divorces, where securing a fair division of marital assets can ensure financial independence. Child custody battles can become contentious, with some women having to counter unfounded allegations aimed at undermining their parental rights. Maintenance support is also a concern, as securing adequate financial support for children can be difficult when ex-partners ignore their responsibilities. Because of concerns regarding the cost of legal help, some women might be reluctant to turn to family law experts when faced with these issues. Access to land and property rights Land or property ownership is vital for economic stability, yet customary laws in some communities still restrict women\"s rights. Widows and female heirs may be denied inheritance, forcing dependence on male relatives. Often a lack of awareness and administrative barriers make it difficult for women to assert their rights. Limited access to legal representation The high cost of legal services prevents many women, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, from defending their rights. Legal aid services are often overstretched and may be unable to provide adequate support in complex cases where quality legal representation is essential. Gender-based violence Gender-based violence (GBV) is widespread in South Africa, with women frequently facing domestic violence, sexual assault, and harassment. In 2022/2023, just over 53,000 South Africans reported being a victim of a sexual crime2, with close to 80% of these being rape.  Without professional legal help, many women hesitate to report these crimes due to stigma, fear of retaliation or insensitive treatment by the police. Cyberbullying and online harassment Women are increasingly vulnerable to cyberbullying, online harassment, and the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. These violations cause emotional distress, reputational damage and financial loss. Women can benefit from expert guidance on cyber laws and the removal of harmful content. 5 Reasons more women are choosing Legal Insurance When considering the legal challenges women face, it\"s understandable why affordable Legal Cover has become indispensable for many women in South Africa. The best Legal Cover provides support across various legal challenges while alleviating the financial burden often associated with legal proceedings. These challenging situations often come with emotional trauma, which can overshadow practicality &ndash; you need a clear-thinking legal advisor who will fight for your best interests. 1. Support in employment disputes Legal Insurance allows women to act against employers who violate the Constitution, the Employment Equity Act, and the Labour Relations Act. Through professional legal advice and support, women can get clarity on employment contracts and understand clauses that may affect their rights. This can empower them to negotiate better terms as well as recognise when their rights are being infringed upon. If disputes escalate, Legal Cover ensures women have professional representation in labour courts or tribunals, advocating on their behalf and increasing the chances of a favourable outcome. 2. Family law support Divorce, even when unopposed, can be complicated and exhausting. The best Legal Cover will provide women with access to family law specialists who can guide them through the legal procedures. This can extend to representation in court to ensure they receive a fair share of marital assets and maintenance support where necessary. Legal professionals can help women build a strong case for maintenance, custody or visitation rights, focusing on the best interests of any child who is involved. Lawyers can also facilitate alternative dispute resolution methods, which are often less adversarial and more cost-effective than litigation. 3. Protection of property rights In many communities, women face barriers to land ownership and inheritance due to customary practices. With affordable Legal Cover offered as part of an insurers&rsquo; value-added products range, women can access essential support that allows them to challenge these practices, whether that means filing claims, contesting wills, or negotiating settlements. Additionally, legal professionals can advise on property transactions &mdash; like buying or selling &mdash; ensuring they are legally sound and fair. Legal support is essential when advocating for gender equality, especially where discriminatory laws or customs persist. 4. Protection for gender-based violence cases Gender-based violence remains a serious concern for South African women. Legal Insurance can provide women with vital support in pursuit of justice. This includes help with police reports, gathering medical evidence and initiating legal proceedings, particularly for women concerned about retaliation. Where necessary, legal professionals can also help secure protection orders quickly. In court, experienced attorneys advocate for victims, ensuring their rights are defended and legal complexities are managed. Beyond legal representation, the support provided by Legal Insurance can extend to connecting women with counselling, shelters and medical care where necessary. 5. Peace of mind Finally, more women are choosing Legal Insurance because of the financial security it provides. By covering the high costs often associated with legal assistance and representation, it allows women to pursue or defend legal actions without the risk of financial hardship. Legal Cover encourages early intervention in legal matters, preventing small issues from escalating, and offers accessible advice with unlimited telephonic support. Get a Legal Cover Insurance quote Legal Cover, as part of 1st for Women\"s value-added products, gives women the confidence to face legal challenges they may otherwise have avoided. It ensures you have the support needed to defend your rights without suffering financial strain, providing peace of mind in difficult situations.

        "content": "Picture this: It&rsquo;s early January 2025, and you sit down to write your goals for the year ahead. But it feels too soon&mdash;you\"re still recovering from the holiday rush. So, you tell yourself the first week is a write-off.Then the second week arrives, and now you\"re in full-on prep mode: gearing up for the new work year, getting the kids ready for school, or juggling both.The future is not something that just happens to us&mdash;it&rsquo;s something we create. As women, we often find ourselves juggling multiple roles: caregiver, partner, friend, colleague. But amid everything, how often do we take the time to envision our future selves? And how that version of ourselves would behave today?The good news is it&rsquo;s never too early or late to start showing up as your future self. The future version of you&mdash;the one who is confident, successful, healthy, financially secure, maintains her boundaries and is living life on her own terms.Here&rsquo;s how you get there:1. Visualise the life you wantTake a moment to really dig deep and think about what you want your future to look like. What career do you want? Where do you want to live? How do you want to dress? What kind of relationships do you nurture? Visualising these aspects of your future will give you a clear picture of the life you&rsquo;re striving for.2. Habits and SystemsYour daily habits and the systems you put in place to achieve your goals will determine whether you achieve them or not. Remember what author James Clear said, &ldquo;You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.&rdquo;Does future you wake up and scroll on social media for hours on end? Or do you wake up, set clear intentions for the day? You choose.3. Setting GoalsStart setting clear, actionable goals that align with your vision. Whether it&rsquo;s investing in your career, prioritising your health, or nurturing your relationships, future you would take these steps without hesitation.4. Take back your power and know your worthFuture you knows her worth and isn\"t afraid to advocate for herself. She doesn&rsquo;t downplay her strengths, nor does she apologise for her ambitions. Today, start embracing your own fearless. Speak up when you deserve recognition, take pride in your accomplishments, and refuse to let imposter syndrome hold you back.4. Make self-care a prioritySelfcare is not just bubble baths and sheet masks (we however highly recommend these) but it&rsquo;s holistic, taking care of yourself inside and out. Take time to check in on you and figure out how you&rsquo;re feeling, whether it&rsquo;s through journaling, going for a walk or speaking to a professional.5. Take small consistent actionsStart with manageable small actions: create a morning routine that sets you up for success, track your finances, invest in learning something new, or reach out to a mentor. These seemingly small actions compound over time to bring you closer to the future you desire.6. Celebrate the winsRemember, future you didn&rsquo;t get where she is by waiting for the &ldquo;perfect moment.&rdquo; She got there by making steady progress, and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doing now. Celebrate every small victory and recognise the fearlessness it takes to go confidently in the direction of your dreams.Future you is waitingStart showing up as the woman you want to become today. Start making the decisions that will create the future you desire, step into your power, and let your actions align with your goals.We can&rsquo;t wait to meet Future You."

        "content": "Life can be full of unexpected twists and turns, so protecting yourself financially against accidents is vital. Covering a range of unforeseen incidents that could impact your ability to work or care for your loved ones, Personal Accident Insurance from 1st for Women offers the peace of mind you need. Accidents can happen even if you&rsquo;re simply going about your day, commuting or exercising. With Personal Accident Cover, you&rsquo;re financially prepared for the unexpected. It&rsquo;s important to understand how this coverage can protect your financial prosperity, and why it&rsquo;s a must-have for smart, forward-thinking women.  Personal accident risks faced by South African women South African women face a wide range of threats in their daily lives, often in environments and situations that seem safe. From household chores to commuting to work or enjoying recreational activities, accidents can happen at any time and anywhere.  Road accidentsThe high number of road accidents in South Africa poses a significant risk to women who regularly drive or commute to work. Factors such as poor road maintenance, unsafe driving conditions, and heavy traffic contribute to the frequency of accidents. According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation, nearly 12,500 people lose their lives on the roads in South Africa each year, with many more sustaining serious injuries that disrupt their day-to-day lives. In a real-world scenario, a woman driving to work could be involved in a minor collision, resulting in injuries that require medical attention and time off work. Personal Accident Insurance would help cover those medical costs and loss of income during recovery.Workplace injuriesAccidents in the workplace are another concern for women, especially in sectors such as retail, healthcare and manufacturing. Employers should have coverage for their staff, but Personal Accident Insurance can help with additional expenses. Slips, trips, and falls, as well as machinery accidents, can happen at any time. Women in factories, for example, face the risk of falling or being injured by heavy machinery while at work. In one hypothetical example, a retail worker could trip and fall while stacking shelves, leading to a fractured ankle. Personal Accident Insurance would help her cover medical bills and loss of income while she recuperates. Domestic accidentsHome &ndash; often seen as a safe place &ndash; can be the source of numerous accidents. Slips, trips, and burns from daily household tasks are common. For instance, a young woman cooking dinner may accidentally burn herself on the hob, requiring emergency care and follow-up treatment. While these accidents are typically minor, the cost of medical treatment can be overwhelming. With Personal Accident Cover in place, there is access to immediate financial aid for medical expenses. Physical assaultViolence against women in South Africa remains a serious threat, with women at higher risk of physical assault in both private and public settings. Statistics South Africa reports that one in five women has experienced physical violence. These assaults can result in significant injuries, requiring hospitalisation and rehabilitation. In such cases, Personal Insurance policies like Personal Accident Insurance provide critical coverage to help cover the costs of medical treatment and therapy.   Exposure to HIV during an accidentIn the unfortunate event of exposure to HIV, such as during a workplace or road accident, immediate medical attention is critical. South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV and those exposed to bodily fluids may require anti-retroviral (ARV) treatment to prevent infection. Insurance ensures that the costs of ARV treatment are promptly covered, safeguarding the health and safety of the victim. Sport and recreational injuriesWomen who participate in sports or other recreational activities are also at risk of injury, whether it&rsquo;s a sprained ankle from a football match, or a fractured wrist from a cycling collision. Personal Accident Cover helps manage the medical expenses and time spent on recovery. For example, a woman who enjoys running might sustain an injury while on the trail, requiring medical care and potentially physical therapy. Personal Accident Insurance means that she has the financial support to recover without the additional stress of wondering how she is going to pay. There are some common myths/misconceptions surrounding Personal Accident Cover, therefore it\"s important to understand the real benefits it provides. 5 ways Personal Accident Insurance can mitigate these risks Accidents can happen when you least expect them and, for South African women, Personal Accident Insurance offers essential protection against the financial consequences of unexpected injuries. Here are five key ways that insurance can help reduce the risks for women in their everyday lives. 1. Financial compensation for medical expensesPersonal Accident Insurance provides coverage for medical treatments and hospital stays following an accident. Whether you slip and fall at home, experience an injury at work, or are involved in a road accident, medical bills can quickly mount up. Without insurance, paying for emergency care, surgery or rehabilitation can result in financial stress for individuals and their families. Personal Accident Cover helps ease the financial strain by covering the costs of treatments, ensuring that you can focus on getting better rather than worrying about the finances. 2. Income replacementWhen an accident leads to temporary or permanent disability, it can disrupt your ability to work and generate income. Insurance offers income replacement, so you can maintain your finances while recovering. Whether you need weeks off due to a broken arm or require long-term rehabilitation after a severe injury, the coverage means that you can meet your financial responsibilities without falling behind on essential expenses. 3. Coverage for accidental death and funeral expensesIn the unfortunate event of an accidental death, this insurance can alleviate the financial burden placed on loved ones by covering the funeral costs. Losing a family member is a heartbreaking experience, and the added pressure of funeral expenses can make it harder. With Personal Accident Cover, your family can receive financial support to help with the funeral arrangements, so that they&rsquo;re not left with unexpected costs during an emotionally difficult time.  4. Lump sum payment for serious injuriesFor severe injuries such as fractures, loss of limbs or permanent disability, Personal Accident Insurance provides a lump sum payment. This payment can be used for a wide range of needs, including long-term care, rehabilitation or home modifications to accommodate a new physical reality. For instance, if a woman suffers an injury to her spinal cord in a road accident, she may need to modify her home with ramps and other accessibility features. The lump sum payment ensures that the necessary changes can be made, helping her adapt to her new living setup. 5. Global coverage for accidentsOne of the most valuable benefits of this insurance is that it often provides global coverage. Whether you&rsquo;re at home, work, or travelling abroad, it ensures you&rsquo;re covered no matter where an accident occurs. This is particularly beneficial for women who travel regularly for work or leisure, providing peace of mind that they&rsquo;re covered financially regardless of their location. From a skiing accident while on holiday to a fall at home, Personal Accident Insurance has you covered wherever you are in the world.

        "content": "South Africans are well accustomed to the need for insurance, but it isn\"t only necessary for protecting your vehicle and home. Home Contents Insurance is equally important to protect your belongings in and around your home. In addition to covering your possessions against a variety of risks, Household Contents Insurance in South Africa can offer other benefits that are easily overlooked. This 1st for Women guide looks at the unexpected items covered by this essential insurance product. Fire, theft, weather, or malicious damage: the major risks to your home contents When considering the risks your home is exposed to, we often dwell on theft and burglary while downplaying the other dangers. Each threat can result in heart-breaking loss and damage to personal belongings. Burglaries and robberies The difference between a burglary and a robbery is that the latter often involves violence, with at least one victim present. Both are common, and possessions are often targeted. In the fourth quarter of 2023, over 40,000 home burglaries and more than 6,300 house robberies were reported across the country 1. Even though smaller items like electronics, jewellery, and cash are favoured, these items are still costly to repair or replace. Fire and smoke damage Fires move quickly and unexpectedly. Faulty wiring, cooking mishaps, lightning strikes, and wildfires can affect any household, rapidly destroying personal items, furniture, and appliances. Even if the fire is contained before spreading too far, you could still be left with most of your belongings damaged by smoke and water. The cost of replacing these is compounded by having to repair the damage to your home.  Damage from weather or natural disasters Severe weather and other natural disasters affect many parts of the country with each season. Heavy rain leads to localised flooding, while strong winds and hail can destroy roofs and windows, resulting in water damage to carpets, furniture, electronics, and more. The April 2022 floods in KwaZulu-Natal resulted in damage to at least 13,000 homes 2, while extreme weather in the Western Cape led to widespread flooding and storm damage in 2023 and 2024. Malicious damage Damage inflicted on purpose, like vandalism or property destruction, isn\"t common but remains a risk. A burglar, angered by not being able to get into your safe, might smash items around your house. Civil unrest can lead to secondary damage, such as spoiled food caused by power cuts or fire and smoke damage from urban fires. Water damage Other than flooding following rain, water damage to your possessions can also be caused by leaking pipes, overflows, and burst geysers. Unnoticed leaks can be particularly bad, resulting in irreversible damage by the time they are discovered. Even if the damage isn\"t widespread, replacing a sofa or part of a seasonal wardrobe can be expensive. Many of us are aware of these major risks and look to have them covered when taking out Home Contents Insurance. Along with Building Insurance, home contents insurance ensures that your home and its contents are covered for loss or repairs caused by common, significant events. Unveiling the secret of added Home Contents Insurance benefits You want insurance coverage that protects your personal belongings against theft, fire, and other major risks. With 1st for Women, you get that, plus a range of additional benefits that go beyond standard coverage. These benefits are easily overlooked or forgotten about. 6 Unexpected items covered by Home Contents Insurance Ever thought about what you might do if you had to temporarily vacate your home following a fire or severe weather damage? Or if a visitor is injured on your property? 1st for Women has, and these are just some surprising items and situations covered by our Household Contents Insurance.  Cover for items outside the home &ndash;Garden furniture, a high-end braai or ceramic grill, and even your laundry could be stolen or damaged. Just because these items aren\"t inside your home when this happens shouldn\"t mean they can&rsquo;t be included in a Home Contents Insurance claim. This includes your smart devices when they\"re on the go. Alternative accommodation &ndash; If a significant incident renders your home temporarily uninhabitable, such as a fire or severe water damage, you&rsquo;ll need somewhere safe to stay. This policy includes coverage for alternative accommodation, taking care of hotel or rental costs until your home is repaired and ready for return. It can also cover the cost of security guards if damaged security measures can\"t be repaired immediately.Spoiled food &ndash; Ageing infrastructure and severe weather can lead to extended power outages. When this happens in the middle of a South African summer, you can easily end up with a fridge and freezer full of spoiled food. With 1st for Women, these items can be part of a Home Contents Insurance claim. Legal liability protection &ndash; A friend or visitor injuring themselves on your property can result in ruinous medical and legal expenses. With legal liability protection included with your Home Contents Insurance, you can ensure these costs are covered without harming the friendship.Handbag cover &ndash; For 1st for Women policyholders, there&rsquo;s a bonus of handbag cover for losses or damages if your handbag and its contents are stolen, lost, or damaged, whether at home or on the go. Even if the bag isn\"t worth much, the personal items inside&mdash;like your phone, wallet, and makeup&mdash;can be costly to replace. The added value of Home Contents Insurance Beyond the tangible coverage for items, 1st for Women&rsquo;s Household Contents Insurance also includes Assist benefits that simplify life&rsquo;s unexpected challenges. These include: Guardian Angel on Call &ndash; Roadside assistance is great to have, but with 1st for Women, this includes being able to order a reliable and trackable towing service. For an extra measure, you can also have a Guardian Angel wait with you until help arrives. Guardian Angel Lifestyle Assist &ndash; This is a comprehensive set of services that help with finding a plumber, electrician and other home services.

        "content": " - Is there such a thing as cheap car insurance? - Anyone can get cheap car insurance. However, we believe that when it comes to cheap car insurance, you get what you pay for! Your premium may be cheap, but you might also be locked into a lot of unnecessary rules about how much you can drive, where, and when. At 1st for Women, we don&rsquo;t want to hold you back, which is why we don&rsquo;t place unreasonable restrictions on you. We aim to offer some of the most affordable women&rsquo;s car insurance in South Africa. While it isn\"t easy to put a price on your wellbeing, we strive to maintain affordable Car Insurance designed specifically for women. All while offering excellent coverage and benefits to help you feel safe. That&rsquo;s why you can save money when you switch to 1st for Women. - Can I use a vehicle repairer of my choice? - Since 2004, we have established excellent working relationships with our network of car experts, and we want you to get the most out of this pre-established network. That&rsquo;s why we insist on using panel beaters of our choice. This way, we can guarantee the quality of the work done on your car. In fact, we offer a lifetime guarantee on the repair work when you claim through us, whether it&rsquo;s a quick paint fix or major panel beating. - How do I lower my car insurance premiums? - There are a few ways you can lower your car insurance premiums: Increase the excess you are required to pay when you claim. However, paying the lowest excess will increase your monthly premium. Ideally, you want a balance between your premium and your excess. By combining your policies, you qualify for discounted premiums. Review your cover annually. Individual circumstances are subject to change, including your coverage needs, like if you&rsquo;ve recently moved to a safer area. - What is the best car insurance? - We&rsquo;ve put together our insurance options with all kinds of women in mind. The best vehicle insurance for you will depend on your own needs. Our Comprehensive Car Insurance offers the best protection against the most extensive array of risks. However, if you rarely drive your car or are looking for insurance for an older, less valuable car, Third Party, Fire and Theft or Third Party Only Cover could be right for you. - Will my premiums decrease as my car gets older? - When you insure your car, you aren\"t only covered for theft, but also for the repair of your vehicle. As your car ages, the cost of repairs and individual parts increase every year. Unfortunately, your premium will need to increase to align with these costs. However, 1st for Women does consider the depreciating value of your car when reviewing your premium on an annual basis. "

        "content": "If your household includes even a single pet, chances are you see them as part of the family. The idea of a pet getting sick or hurt can bring the same feeling of dread as if it were a human family member. However, the costs associated with keeping pets safe and healthy can add up quickly. This makes Pet Insurance a necessity, ensuring you can prioritise their well-being, from routine healthcare to treating serious conditions. Pet protection is something 1st for Women has always valued, and in this guide, we look at some of the latest trends when it comes to Pet Insurance in South Africa. 5 Common risks pet owners face in South Africa Approximately 45% of South African adults are pet owners 1, and in 2022, the local pet industry was valued at R7.1 billion. With a projected growth of 2.5% by 2026 2, this shows an increasing focus on pet wellness. However, with only about 1% of pets insured 3, many potential costs could surprise pet owners. 1. Unexpected medical emergencies Not counting your cat or dog being struck by a vehicle, many pet health issues easily turn into medical emergencies. Our pets can\"t always communicate pain clearly, and symptoms of illness can be overlooked until they become critical. You won\"t know that Bingo has swallowed a rubber band or piece of string, but you might notice digestive issues a few days later. Medical emergencies are unexpected and often require costly diagnostics, surgery, and treatment plans. X-rays and scans can cost up to R8,500, while complex surgeries may exceed R30,000. 2. Theft or loss of pets A gate carelessly left open can be extremely tempting to even the most obedient pet, leading to them becoming lost. Pet theft&mdash;especially of valuable breeds&mdash;is also becoming common in South Africa. Pet Insurance doesn&rsquo;t typically cover lost or stolen pets, but if reunited, having your pet checked for injuries can be beneficial. And the best Pet Insurance in South Africa will always include a routine and minor care benefit, which can be used for this. 3. Chronic and breed-specific health conditions Selective breeding and a limited gene pool result in certain breeds of cats and dogs being prone to certain health conditions. Breathing difficulties are common in flat-nose breeds like Bulldogs, Pugs, and Persians, while Great Danes and German Shepherds are at risk of gastric torsion. Some conditions can result in medical emergencies, while most will require some form of chronic treatment. Sometimes breed-specific conditions are covered by Pet Insurance. Without any cover you\"d have to carry the cost of this yourself. 4. Liability for pet-related accidents or damage The risk of your pet injuring someone or damaging the property of others is possible. Kitty might get tangled in a guest\"s feet, causing them to fall and sprain their wrist. Meanwhile, Max the Rottweiler gleefully chewed through the fender of the plumber who came to fix some leaks. Affordable Pet Insurance with third-party liability cover can assist with the cost of injuries or damage caused by one of your pets. 5. High costs of end-of-life care As pets age, you\"ll eventually be faced with emotionally challenging end-of-life care. This might include more frequent trips to the vet, palliative care, and even medically justified euthanasia. The emotional toll is significant, and end-of-life care costs can be overwhelming. The best Pet Insurance in South Africa should reimburse you for many of these costs, along with offering a dignified ending or cremation benefit. Some of South Africa&rsquo;s latest Pet Insurance trends Insurance for pets has been available to South African pet owners for more than a decade. As with any insurance product, it continues to evolve, influenced by both societal trends and what policy holders&mdash;or pet lovers&mdash;want. Some of the major trends that have emerged include:  Comprehensive coverage plans on the rise You\"re no longer limited to basic pet cover, with comprehensive plans more common and increasingly popular. More pet owners want their pets covered for both emergencies and long-term care. Comprehensive plans offer all-encompassing protection that might include hereditary conditions. Wellness and preventative care inclusions More insurers are including wellness and preventative or routine care benefits in their coverage. These benefits cover annual (or more frequent) check-ups, vaccinations, deworming, and other procedures. Preventative care can help pet owners detect and address health issues early, which may result in lower treatment costs over time. Including these in affordable Pet Insurance plans makes routine health maintenance easier and encourages a proactive approach to pet wellness. Flexible plans and perks Insurers now offer multiple plans and additional perks that suit different needs. No two pets are the same, nor are their health requirements. If your Coco is an indoor cat with almost no risk of serious injuries or liability claims, you\"d be happy with adequate routine care benefits, and less of the other benefits. As she gets older, you might want to include diagnostics, scans, and a bigger surgery and hospitalisation benefit. Having access to multiple plans means you can increase coverage as your pet\"s needs change. Multi-pet discounts Many families have multiple pets and are more interested in policies that offer discounted premiums for including more than one pet on a specific plan. Multi-pet discounts make coverage affordable. These discounts allow pet owners to protect their furry family without stretching their budget. Digital claims and customer support innovations Digital platforms are simplifying the claims process, with many insurers offering apps or online portals for easy claim submissions and customer support. Some insurers also provide a 24/7 line for expert emergency and health advice. Convenience is a priority for today&rsquo;s pet owners and digital claims streamline the process, making it faster and more efficient.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Many things work better in pairs &mdash; like burgers and chips, bats and balls, beers and braais. While the category of affordable insurance is less glamorous than these examples, some forms of insurance also work better when you combine them &mdash; and the benefits you could experience from doing so can be more than you expected. Of course, not all insurers allow you to stack up their products &mdash; but 1st for Women does. Combining your Car Insurance and Home insurance into a single policy can benefit you &mdash; and, at the same time, remove some potential insurance annoyances. 4 common insurance challenges and how bundling policies can help The biggest and most practical benefit of bundling your Home Insurance and Car Insurance is saving on your monthly premiums. However, you will not only save money but there are other hurdles you can overcome by bundling your insurance policies. 1. High premium costs In some instances, people have different insurers for different types of insurance &ndash; one company for Car Insurance and a different one for Home Insurance. This obviously would make bundling impossible. If your different policies are all with the same insurer it might seem obvious that bundling two affordable insurance products into one can help you save money, but you might not have considered whether your current insurer allows this in the first place. Often, customers discover their insurers aren\"t equipped to offer this option or only provide it when you let them know you\"re considering leaving them for another insurer.  2. Complex claims processes For many, the insurance claims process can be almost as painful as the incident triggering the claim in the first place. Research by the Financial Services Conduct Authority tells us that insurance is a misunderstood financial product and that a lack of disclosure means that many people have misconceptions about what their affordable insurance does and doesn\"t cover. This is exacerbated when policies are spread across insurers, who all do things differently.By working with a single insurer, you can save time and countless unnecessary explanations because you can place claims once through a single point of contact with someone who has a holistic view of your insurance and claims history. 3. Coverage gaps Negotiating the terms and conditions of two separate insurance products is challenging when you are working with two companies that don\"t communicate with each other. It can leave you feeling like a go-between as you scramble between the two to ensure that nothing has fallen through the cracks and that you haven\"t accidentally overinsured something. With a single insurer assisting you, you can detect and close coverage gaps and only pay for what you want and need. Remember that even if you over-insure or double insure something accidentally, it could be considered fraud and result in your policies and overall coverage getting cancelled. 4. Multiple renewal dates and a lack of personalisation It\"s advisable that you revisit your Car Insurance and Home Insurance once a year to update or make any necessary changes. This is just easier to do from a practical standpoint when you\"re dealing with a single insurer and insurance policy. When you work with an insurer that has a more holistic view of your lifestyle, you could get the kind of personalised service that anticipates your needs before you even express them. Here\"s an example of how this could work for you.Vera is a young, single woman who switches to 1st for Women and bundles her Car Insurance and Home Insurance to save money. She works with a single point of contact in all her insurance dealings through her Customer Service Agent, Bob. Over the years, Bob witnesses Vera\"s life evolve as she trades her hand-me-down hatchback for a family-friendly minivan and swaps life in the city for small-town living.Because Bob witnesses Vera\"s lifestyle changes, he helps her keep her insurance coverage relevant and customised to her needs. For example, when she purchases a new minivan, he suggests she upgrade her Car Insurance from Third Party Only to Comprehensive.When Vera contacts Bob to update her insurance details as she is moving to a small town outside of the city, Bob suggests that she top-up her Car Insurance with Tyre and Rim Insurance, to accommodate the fact that she might be travelling further distances on rural roads, which could shorten the lifespan of her car\"s tyres.Finally, as Vera prepares to welcome twins with her husband, Bob is on hand to remind her to update her Home Insurance to include all the furniture and equipment she has purchased for them.

There could even be other value-added products you could add to the mix to further round out your coverage.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Anyone who knows you knows that you view your pets as family members. You put as much love into maintaining their well-being as you do with your human children, providing them with healthy food, stimulating toys and medical aid. While these investments can improve your pet&rsquo;s quality of life, additional insurance can come in handy to help you afford the best care for your pets should they get sick or injured &mdash; or recoup unexpected costs relating to this. 1st for Women knows how you feel and wants to help you understand how to place a Pet Insurance claim when the time comes. The importance of understanding your policy Pet Insurance is something that allows you to claim the cost of specific veterinary procedures or treatment back from an insurer. In other words, you pay the service provider (usually the vet) and then claim the money back from your insurer. If you have some form of insurance or are considering taking it out, you can pat yourself on the back for being part of the 6% of the South African population who\"ve taken this critical step to protect their finances while having a pet.Negotiating a claim after your car is stolen or someone snatches your handbag can be stressful. However, these stolen items are merely tools that help you live your life&mdash;having to submit a claim concerning an injured or ill pet will naturally be more stressful. You might find yourself accountable for huge costs, and having to deal with this can be financially taxing when you\"re already emotionally concerned about your pet\"s recovery.For this reason, getting affordable Pet Insurance and then forgetting about it until you want to make a claim is a bad idea. We recommend familiarising yourself with the details of your chosen cover before you need to use it &mdash; by examining its inclusions, exclusions, waiting periods and terms and conditions. Your next step will be familiarising yourself with the claims process. 4 easy steps to file a Pet Insurance claim To make your Pet Insurance claim process as simple and painless as possible when it does happen, here\"s how you should organise yourself in advance. 1. Create a file When you take out medical aid, your insurer collects important details on you to create a medical record of your care. This is updated to include treatments and procedures you\"ve undergone, medication you\"ve taken as well as details on the dates, costs and paperwork involved.Creating a document like this for your pet will help your insurer get an up-to-date summary of your pet\"s status when you claim, so they can process it more accurately and quickly. Important details include your pet\"s medical records and history, your insurance policy number, proof of payment for the procedure or treatment they underwent and detailed and itemised invoices with relevant billing codes. 2. Check your cover Before making a claim, you need to know if it will be covered or not or if terms and conditions might apply. For example, if you notice your dog has developed a mild limp that you suspect is age-related, you could be subject to a 30-day waiting period to access a diagnostic benefit and confirm this &ndash; and if your dog was limping before you took out the Pet Insurance policy, it might not be covered at all. 3. Complete the paperwork Notify your insurer of your proposed claim. They will be able to advise you on how to proceed. Once you have all your information and know that your claim falls under your coverage, you can go ahead and make the claim, completing the provided form in as much detail as possible. When doing this, take your time and make sure you have all the supportive paperwork handy and that this paperwork includes the correct treatment or billing codes. Ensure that every required section is completed legibly and correctly, avoiding spelling or numerical errors &ndash; and keep a copy of it. In addition, make sure you have a digital copy of any relevant bills or payment invoices before submitting it to the provided email address.Remember that even an accidental omission or error can result in your claim being rejected, so be as accurate and careful as possible. 4. Follow up Once your claim is lodged, make a note of the claim processing number you\"ll be provided with and the turnaround time for feedback given. Follow up if this time lapses without you getting a response. What happens when you submit a Pet Insurance claim Typically it takes between 7 - 10 working days to process a Pet Insurance claim in South Africa. On submission of your claim, you will be given a reference number. Make sure that you keep this number handy. You can usually track this online to see how it&rsquo;s progressing. Once the claim has been decided, you will be notified of the outcome: approval or rejection. If it is approved, the insurer will calculate the payment due to you and pay it directly into your bank account. What to do if your Pet insurance claim is denied or rejected What happens if your claim is rejected or denied? Before you panic, realise that in many cases, this might be an automatic rejection due to missing details or paperwork. In this case, your insurer will let you know how to resolve the issue. A common cause for a claim rejection is when customers scan a print invoice from a vet or animal hospital and email this to their insurer &mdash; not realising the scanned image is unclear and illegible. In this case, you can solve the issue by requesting a digital copy of your invoice from the vet or animal hospital. A claim might also get rejected because you simply aren\"t covered for it, indicating that you need to revisit your cover.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Tyre and rim damage can put you at risk on the roads and can be expensive to fix. From potholes and irregular surfaces to sharp debris, there&rsquo;s a lot on South African roads that can damage your tyres and rims. Tyre and Rim Insurance is thus vital when shielding your vehicle from the high costs of unexpected damages and repairs. With 1st for Women Rim and Tyre Cover, you can drive confidently, knowing you&rsquo;re prepared for any bumps in the road. This guide outlines the most common types of damage, how to prevent them, and why Tyre Insurance is a great option. 4 common types of tyre damage 1. Punctures and tearsWhat it is and how it&rsquo;s caused: Punctures occur when sharp objects such as glass or nails pierce the tyre, creating a small hole. Tears are more severe and can be caused by hitting potholes or sharp edges.How to identify:  Look for puncture marks or deflated tyres and listen for hissing from escaping air. 2. Sidewall damage or bulgeWhat it is and how it&rsquo;s caused: Often caused by impacts with curbs, potholes, or overloading the vehicle, this type of damage affects the sidewall of a tyre. Bulges appear when internal cords are broken.How to identify: Check for visible cracks or lumps on the sidewall. A bulge indicates serious structural damage and requires immediate replacement. 3. Irregular tread wearWhat it is and how it&rsquo;s caused: Irregular wear patterns on the surface of the tyre result from misaligned wheels, incorrect inflation, or unbalanced tyres. Specific types include:Heel and toe wear &ndash; caused by improper rotation or suspension issues.Centre-wear &ndash; often caused by overinflation, resulting in excessive wear in the middle.One-sided wear &ndash; caused by poor alignment or suspension issues.How to identify: Check the tyre tread for uneven patterns or sections with noticeably less depth. 4. BlowoutsWhat is it and how it&rsquo;s caused: Sudden tyre failure when the tyre bursts, often caused by underinflation, overloading, or existing damage.How to identify: Typically it occurs when driving, resulting in a large bang, rapid deflation and loss of control. Types of rim damage that you should pay attention to 1. Curb rashWhat it is and how it&rsquo;s caused: Curb rash refers to scratches or scrapes on the rim caused by hitting curbs when parking or while making turns.How to identify: Look for visible scratches, scuffs, or gouges on the surface of the rim. In some cases, it may also result in peeling paint or damage to the rim&rsquo;s finish. 2. Bent rimsWhat it is and how it&rsquo;s caused: Bent rims can occur when the wheel hits a pothole, speed bump, or other hard surfaces with significant force.How to identify: Noticeable vibrations when driving, difficulty steering, or uneven tyre wear can indicate a bent rim. Check for uneven edges or warping. 3. CorrosionWhat it is and how it&rsquo;s caused: Corrosion happens when moisture and road salts react with the material of the rim, causing it to oxidise or rust. This is especially common in winter months or in areas with high humidity.How to identify: Look for discolouration, pitting, or flaking on the rim&rsquo;s surface. Corrosion can weaken the rim and affect its structural integrity over time. 4. Cracks and breaksWhat it is and how it&rsquo;s caused: Cracks or breaks in the rim are usually caused by repeated heavy impact, stress, or long-term exposure to harsh driving conditions.How to identify: Check for visible cracks, especially along the edges or spokes. Driving with a cracked rim often leads to tyre pressure loss or instability.Looking out for these types of rim damage and addressing issues promptly can enhance safety, prolong the lifespan of your wheels and maintain the value of your vehicle. Regular inspections and careful driving are your best defence. How tyre and rim damage negatively impacts your vehicle Reduced fuel efficiencyTyre and rim damage, such as bent rims or uneven tread wear, increases rolling resistance, requiring the engine to work harder to move the vehicle. This results in higher fuel consumption, costing you more in the long run. Compromised handling and breakingDamaged tyres and rims can reduce stability and traction, leading to poor handling, especially in wet or uneven road conditions. Cracked rims or worn tyres make braking less effective, increasing stopping distances and making your vehicle less responsive in an emergency. This BizCommunity report provides valuable insights into how wet weather affects your car&rsquo;s tyres and offers practical tips for staying safe on slippery roads. Increased risk of accidentsTyre blowouts or cracked rims can lead to sudden loss of control, particularly at high speeds. Damaged rims and tyres are less likely to hold air properly, making it difficult to maintain a safe distance and smooth ride. This increases the likelihood of collisions, endangering everyone on the road. Higher long-term repair costsIgnoring tyre and rim damage can lead to growing issues, such as misaligned suspension systems or uneven tyre wear, requiring premature replacements. These problems can increase the cost of repair bills significantly if not addressed properly.Addressing damages early not only ensures your safety but also saves you money by preventing further complications. Regular maintenance and inspections are key to keeping your vehicle in good condition. The best tips to help prevent tyre and rim damage 1. Regularly check tyre pressureMaintain recommended inflation levels as per your vehicle&rsquo;s requirements to prevent unnecessary stress on tyres and rims. 2. Avoid overloading your vehicleExcess weight can lead to tyre blowouts or bent rims. Stick to your vehicle&rsquo;s load limit for safe driving. 3. Rotate tyres regularlyPromote even tread by rotating tyres as recommended by your vehicle manufacturer.   4. Drive cautiously on poor roadsSlow down for potholes, rough roads, and speed bumps to minimise impact damage. 5. Inspect tyres frequentlyLook for bulges, punctures, or uneven wear that could compromise performance and safety. 6. Park carefullyAvoid hitting curbs, which can cause rim scratches and alignment issues. 7. Clean rims regularlyPrevent corrosion by washing rims with a mild detergent and water mixture, especially after exposure to mud or road salts. 8. Use rim protectorsYou can install rim protectors as a safeguard against scratches and curb rash. 9.

Here are three key trends shaping Home and Car Insurance in 2025: 1.

Insurers are adjusting rates to reflect the increased risk, impacting homeowners in affected areas.Incentives for climate-resilient home improvements: To minimise risks, insurers are introducing policies that incentivise homeowners to implement climate-resilient upgrades, including enhanced roofing and flood-proofing. These initiatives aim to reduce potential damages and encourage sustainable living practices.3.      Telematics and Car InsuranceAdoption of telematics for behaviour-based pricing: Based on a report by ITWeb, telematics devices and mobile application usage in South Africa is on the rise.

        "description": "",
        "content": "Navigating the complexities of a Car Warranty can be overwhelming, but for savvy women, understanding the ins and outs of these contracts is vital. At 1st for Women, we understand that your car isn&rsquo;t just a vehicle &ndash; it&rsquo;s your lifeline. Whether you&rsquo;re wondering about coverage options or how to choose the best product for your needs, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. This guide will answer your most pressing questions to help you make informed decisions. What is a Car Warranty? A Car Warranty1 is a contract between the manufacturer or third party and the vehicle owner, providing repairs or replacements for specific parts if they fail due to manufacturing defects. It&rsquo;s designed to offer peace of mind by covering unexpected repair costs for mechanical and electrical failure during the warranty period, ensuring your car stays in peak performance.There are two main types of Car Warranties:  Manufacturer&rsquo;s WarrantyThis type of warranty is included with the purchase of a new car and typically covers defects in parts and workmanship. It can last for a set number of years or mileage, whichever comes first. Manufacturer&rsquo;s warranties usually cover essential components such as the electrical systems, engine, and transmission against factory defects. Extended WarrantyThis is an optional plan you can purchase to extend coverage beyond the expiry date of the Manufacturer\"s Warranty. It offers ongoing protection for major vehicle components, often including additional services like roadside assistance or coverage for more parts. Extended Warranties are suitable for those planning to keep their vehicle for a longer period, offering extra assurance against costly repairs down the road. Why Car Warranties matter for women drivers  Having a Car Warranty offers countless benefits for women drivers, including convenience, cost savings, and confidence on the road.Convenience is a major advantage, as a warranty reduces the stress and hassle of dealing with unforeseen breakdowns. Whether you&rsquo;re commuting to work or heading off on a weekend getaway, knowing that repairs are covered means you can focus on your journey without worrying about car issues.Cost savings are another excellent benefit. Car repairs can be expensive, especially for major mechanical and electrical components. A warranty covers these costs, preventing the need to use your savings for unexpected expenses. This makes maintaining your vehicle more manageable.Confidence on the road is priceless, particularly when travelling solo or on long road trips. A warranty means that help is just a phone call away and any significant issues are handled. Having a Car Warranty offers countless benefits. 6 Key factors to consider when choosing a Car Warranty For smart drivers, selecting the right warranty involves understanding several crucial factors. Here&rsquo;s what to bear in mind: 1. Coverage areasCheck which parts and systems the warranty covers. Does it include major components like the engine and transmission? A comprehensive warranty offers more protection. 2. DurationLook at the warranty\"s duration, either in terms of mileage or years. Make sure the duration aligns with how long you plan to keep your car. 3. Exclusions and limitationsBe aware of common exclusions like routine maintenance and wear-and-tear items like brake pads and tyres. Understanding these limitations prevents nasty surprises later. 4. Cost and payment optionsConsider the cost of the warranty and whether it offers upfront payments or monthly plans. Go for an option that fits your budget without compromising on coverage. 5. Reputation of the warranty providerResearch the provider&rsquo;s reputation and their track record for honouring claims. A trustworthy provider ensures a smoother experience. 6. Claims processUnderstand the claims process, including how to file claims and whether your preferred repair shops are authorised. 5 Common mistakes to avoid when taking out a Car Warranty When taking out a vehicle warranty, it&rsquo;s easy to make mistakes that could be costly later. Here are some of the common pitfalls to avoid: 1. Not reading the fine printMany drivers overlook the small print, missing important exclusions or limits. For example, warranties often exclude wear-and-tear items like tyres and brake pads. Knowing what&rsquo;s covered, and what isn&rsquo;t, prevents unexpected costs. 2. Ignoring maintenance requirementsFailing to follow your vehicle&rsquo;s maintenance schedule can void the warranty. Imagine missing an oil change and then experiencing engine trouble. If the warranty provider finds out about the lapse in maintenance, they might refuse to cover the repair. Always follow the recommended service intervals. 3. Overlooking the reputation of the providerNot researching the warranty provider can lead to poor service. Look for customer reviews and ratings to make sure you choose a reliable provider. 4. Choosing based on price aloneGoing for the cheapest warranty might seem like a good way to save money, but the warranty could lack adequate coverage. Weigh up the cost with the quality of protection offered. 5. Failing to understand the claims processA complicated claims process can be stressful. Ensure you know how to file claims and check if your preferred repair shops are authorised.When should you get Extended Car Warranty  Deciding when to take out an Extended Vehicle Warranty is crucial to maximising its benefits. The best time is often before your manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty expires. By securing an Extended Car Warranty early, you get continuous coverage, avoiding gaps that could leave you vulnerable to costly repairs.An Extended Car Warranty is also a savvy move when purchasing a used car, especially if the original manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty has lapsed. Used cars are older and, therefore, more likely to experience problems, and an Extended Warranty can provide reassurance against unexpected breakdowns.Additionally, an Extended Vehicle Warranty is worthwhile if you plan to keep your vehicle long-term or drive high mileage annually. High-mileage vehicles typically face more damage, increasing the likelihood of needing repairs. An Extended Warranty helps manage these costs so your car remains in good condition without impacting your budget.Get a Car Warranty quote from 1st for Women Want to protect your car against sudden electrical or mechanical failure?

        "content": "According to the World Economic Forum, at the current rate of progress, it will take until 2158 (roughly five generations) to reach full gender equality. This is unless swift, decisive steps are taken to drastically accelerate the change.That&rsquo;s why the 2025 International Women&rsquo;s Day campaign calls for increased momentum and urgency. A call that 1st for Women has been answering since 2005. With the support of our customers, the 1st for Women Foundation has raised over R100 million and helped to actively assist over 100 000 women.Since we never decelerate our efforts, we help more and more women every day. Of course, the goal is to bring the number of women who need this help down to zero. That&rsquo;s why in 2024 we launched our Generation None campaign.Generation None highlights the fact that one in 3 women will experience GBV in her lifetime &ndash; and aims to bring that one to none. To turn this vision into a reality requires ongoing commitment and continuous support of organisations who are fearlessly fighting GBV.These include organisations like Lawyers Against Abuse, The Tears Foundation, Action Breaks silence and many more. In addition, we have donated over R57 million to national community initiatives focused on GBV prevention. We have also donated R9 million to our flagship programme in Diepsloot. The programme addresses the root cause of the epidemic through education, and provides support for survivors of abuse, from trauma to prosecution.As a business we also support our customers in enforcing their legal rights, in every situation, by offering invaluable Legal Cover. You can choose from four different options to suit your needs and budget. Find out more about Legal Cover here.Protection from GBV, however does not depend on having legal cover. Support is available to you and anyone you know, through organisations like The Tears Foundation. In fact, we contributed over R5 million to the development of The Tears Foundation Digital tool, which allows for quick access to help, in your specific area. You can contact tears on 08000 TEARS (08000 83277) or dial *134* 7355#.As the world commemorates International Women&rsquo;s Month, we remind you that we accelerate action against GBV, all year round. A portion of every comprehensive vehicle insurance premium goes directly towards GBV prevention and support initiatives. If you don&rsquo;t have vehicle insurance with us, consider getting a quote and making a difference here.First For Women is a licensed non-life insurer and Financial Services Provider.

        "description": "",
        "content": " - What vehicles are classified as caravans and trailers? - Caravans and trailers are classified as two different kinds of vehicles. According to South African regulations, a caravan is a mobile trailer that is fitted with living accommodations and weighs less than 3.5 tonnes. That means that any mobile living space that&rsquo;s attached to a frame with wheels below this weight will be classified as a caravan and can be covered by a caravan insurance company.  On the other hand, a trailer is an unpowered vehicle designed or adapted to be towed by a motor vehicle. Unlike caravans, which serve as homes on wheels, trailers are designed only to carry goods and require special trailer insurance in South Africa.  - Does Trailer or Caravan Insurance also cover the valuables inside? - No. 1st for Women Trailer and Caravan Insurance does not include cover for the valuables you stored inside. However, you can cover this content through our Caravan Loose Contents Insurance and Portable Possessions Insurance. These policies will cover your possession for theft, loss, accidental damage, and damage caused by acts of nature.  - What isn’t covered under Trailer or Caravan Insurance? - You will not be covered f you are driving without a valid driver&rsquo;s licence or with an endorsed or invalid licence. The same can be said if you&rsquo;re found to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while behind the wheel. And, if your trailer or caravan is not roadworthy or if you are transporting loads that exceed their registered capacity, your trailer or caravan insurance claim will be rejected. While you are covered anywhere in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, we won&rsquo;t pay out for damage you might cause to third parties or their property if you&rsquo;re beyond the borders of South Africa.   - Does a caravan have to be insured? - No, it&rsquo;s not compulsory to have trailer or caravan insurance in South Africa However, First for Women Insurance highly recommends protecting your assets against the risk of damage or loss, which could amount to costly repair or replacement. Rather have peace of mind that you&rsquo;re covered with insurance for a caravan or trailer.   - Does your Trailer or Caravan Insurance cover wear and tear? - No. Wear and tear on your caravan and trailer is inevitable with ageing. 1st For Women does not include cover for loss and damage that results from general deterioration This wear and tear includes any degradation that was not sudden or unforeseen. So if you haven&rsquo;t maintained your trailer or used it for a purpose other than what it was built for and it breaks, you won&rsquo;t be covered. We also can&rsquo;t cover damage caused due to rust, defective lubrication or a lack of oil. Mechanical, electrical and electronic defects or failures aren&rsquo;t covered either. Nor are parts with a limited life span.   "

All this is covered with the 1st for Women&rsquo;s comprehensive boat and watercraft insurance policy. - Does a boat need to be insured?  - No, it&rsquo;s not a legal requirement to have your boat or watercraft vessel insured. However, due to the risk factors associated with potential damage and the high costs of repair or replacement, First for Women recommends getting an insurance policy for your watercraft.   - What types of watercraft do you cover? - We offer Boat Insurance for any South African-registered watercraft that is used on water for domestic or social reasons. This includes a motor boat, ski boat, speed boat, rowing boat, fishing boat, single hull boat, yacht, or jet ski.   - In what waters are my watercraft insured? - You have the freedom and independence to travel and adventure to your heart&rsquo;s content, so it makes sense that your boat insurance should travel with you. Our comprehensive Watercraft and Boat Insurance will ensure you are covered even when your adventures take you to foreign waters, such as Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  - What isn’t covered under your Watercraft Insurance? - Our Watercraft Insurance is designed to protect you and your vessel in the most comprehensive way possible. However, there are some exceptions. If you transport your watercraft via road travel, the trailer you use will not be insured. However, it can be insured separately with our Caravan &amp; Trailer Insurance. You will not be covered for vessel damage or loss due to faulty repair work, latent defects or poor maintenance. This includes damage caused by insects or pests.  Finally, we don&rsquo;t insure you against piracy or racing. Furthermore, your insurance claim will be rejected if the craft is seized or confiscated by a legal maritime authority.     - What does boat insurance cost?  - This will vary. However, we use the same factors to calculate your premiums if you need insurance for a boat, jet ski, speed boat, fishing boat or yacht. These include the watercraft&rsquo;s make, model and age, its value, where it&rsquo;s housed, what type of motor it has, and how and where it will be used. We also factor in personal information such as your gender, age, and experience in watercraft navigation. "

        "content": "Did you know that insurers don&rsquo;t just look at property value and location when calculating your Buildings Insurance premium? Hidden factors such as plumbing, security upgrades, and even past claims can significantly impact your costs. Understanding these overlooked influences is important if your premium seems higher than expected and you&rsquo;re looking for ways to reduce it. At 1st for Women, we can help you take control of your coverage by sharing these seven surprising factors that affect your premiums. Women are currently driving the SA property marketOver the last few years, women have emerged as key players in South Africa&rsquo;s property market, surpassing men in property ownership and reshaping traditional dynamics. According to data from Lightstone Property, female buyers account for approximately 38% of property ownership in the country, while male buyers represent 29%, and mixed-gender couples hold 33%. Several factors contribute to this trend:1.     Financial independence: Growing participation in the workforce has empowered more women to invest in property.2.     Delayed marriages: With many women now choosing to marry later in life, there&rsquo;s a growing inclination to secure personal assets independently.3.     Investment savvy: Recognising real estate as a stable investment, women are proactively building wealth through property ownership.Women are predominantly active in the residential property sector. According to RE/MAX, 72,000 properties were purchased in South Africa by single women last year.While women are purchasing more properties, they tend to invest in lower-priced brackets compared to men and mixed-gender couples.The provinces with the highest activity among female buyers are Gauteng and the Western Cape, followed by KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.This increase in female property ownership not only reflects the changing societal norms but also signifies women&rsquo;s growing influence in South African real estate. Why savvy women take out Buildings InsuranceFor women investing in property in South Africa, Building Insurance is an essential measure against unexpected structural damage. Whether you own a commercial or residential property, having the right coverage ensures that your valuable investment remains protected from expensive repairs or rebuilding expenses caused by unforeseen events. Protection against unforeseen eventsWith 1st for Women Buildings Insurance, the property&rsquo;s structure&mdash;including the roof, walls, and permanent fixtures (such as fitted kitchens and bathrooms)&mdash;is covered against damages from floods, fires, storms, and other natural disasters. Without this in place, repairing or rebuilding could cause huge financial strain on home and business property owners.  Safeguarding financial security and stabilityAs women lead the way in property ownership, safeguarding their financial future is even more critical. Unexpected structural damage can result in costly repairs, but a well-structured Building Insurance policy helps absorb these expenses, preventing financial setbacks and supporting long-term security. Added benefits for peace of mindIn addition to structural coverage, 1st for Women offers additional benefits, including access to emergency services such as electricians, locksmiths, and plumbers and alternative accommodation should a property become uninhabitable. These added benefits mean that homeowners are never left vulnerable during challenging times. 3 Less commonly known factors impacting your Buildings Insurance premiumsMany homeowners know that location and property value influence Buildings Insurance premiums, but several less well-known factors also play a role. Being aware of these can help you make informed decisions and potentially lower your insurance costs.1. Claims historyPast insurance claims &ndash; even from previous properties &ndash; can influence your premiums. Frequent claims suggest a higher risk to insurers, leading to increased costs. Maintaining a claims-free history where possible can work in your favour when negotiating premiums.2. Replacement costReplacement cost refers to what it would take to rebuild your home or business premises from scratch. Properties with unique architectural designs, custom finishes, or expensive materials often have higher replacement costs &ndash; resulting in increased premiums. Having accurate valuations can help prevent underinsurance while managing costs.3. Safety featuresInstalling security systems including fire alarms and smoke detectors can save you money and your property. 1st for Women offers potential discounts for homes fitted with these protective measures, as they lower the risk of fire, theft, and costly damages.

        "content": " - How do pet insurance claims work? -  With pet insurance claims, the policyholder pays for veterinary services and submits a claim to their insurers. The insurer will reimburse the policyholder for the covered expenses up to the policy&rsquo;s limits and deductibles. You just need to submit a claim form, invoice, and proof of payment from the vet.  Claims for admission to an animal hospital or for surgery require pre-authorisation. For a planned procedure, this should be done before your pet is admitted. A veterinary history may be requested if further information is required. You can submit a claim via email at petclaims@firstforwomen or call us at 0861 20 13 13.  - What is included in the Wellness Benefit? - Our Wellness Benefit pays towards routine, preventative care which covers voluntary sterilisation, vaccinations, deworming, tick and flea control, anal gland expression and nail clipping.  - Does pet insurance cover sterilisation?  - Yes, provided you have the Wellness Benefit, your policy with 1st for Women will pay towards voluntary sterilisation for your pets. - How are policies underwritten? - You&rsquo;ll be asked to disclose any pre-existing conditions when you take out a policy."
